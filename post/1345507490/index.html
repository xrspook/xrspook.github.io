<p><strong>COMPLETE WWE SUMMERSLAM 2012 PPV COVERAGE</strong></p>
<p>By Mike Johnson on 2012-08-19 20:30:00</p>
<p>World champion Sheamus vs. Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>They locked up and Sheamus backed him into the corner. They tried to muscle each other back and forth but the referee broke them up. This time Del Rio backed up Sheamus, who nailed him with a punch. They locked up and fell out of the ring to the floor.</p>
<p>Sheamus went into the ringside table. They battled back and forth on the floor. Sheamus tossed him back in but was kicked in the head as he returned through the ropes. Del Rio worked over Sheamus in the corner. Sheamus kicked off a charge and nailed a neckbreaker for a two count. Sheamus worked over Del Rio with a series of rights.</p>
<p>Sheamus used a rolling senton for a two count. Sheamus placed Alberto on the top rope and Sheamus went under putting Del Rio on his shoulders. Alberto grabbed the buckle to hold on and ripped it off. Del Rio escaped and went for the cross armbreaker but Sheamus slipped out and went for the Brogue Kick.</p>
<p>Del Rio drilled Sheamus, knocking him to the floor and rammed him backwards into the steel stairs. Del Rio came off the top with a shoulderblock and covered him for a two count. Sheamus fought back but was kicked in the leg and covered for a two count.</p>
<p>Sheamus fought his way out of a chinlock and nailed a series of headbutts but was cut off. Alberto stomped him down to the mat and covered him for a near fall. Del Rio mocked Sheamus&rsquo; mannerisms. He teased going for the Brogue Kick but was cut off with a Polish Hammer. Sheamus began working him over but was sent shoulder-first into the ringpost. Sheamus went to the top but was nailed. Alberto yanked him, bad arm first, off the ropes, driving him down for a two count.</p>
<p>Del Rio continued working over Sheamus who tried to muscle him onto his shoulders. Alberto rolled through and locked on the cross armbreaker. Sheamus tried to fire up and pulled Del Rio up and dropped him into a powerbomb. Carlos Newton was smiling somewhere.</p>
<p>Sheamus nailed White Noise for a two count. He set up for the Brogue Kick but Alberto stepped out of the way. Sheamus caught him in the ropes and worked him over with a series of shots across the chest. Sheamus rained down with punched in the corner but Del Rio dropped down and drove him into the exposed buckle. Del Rio nailed the leaping enziguiri for a near fall.</p>
<p>Ricardo, who got up on the apron to celebrate, then tried to toss Del Rio a shoe but the referee saw him. Alberto was so mad, he dragged Ricardo in and nailed him. Ricardo rolled out but his shoe was left in the ring. Sheamus nailed Del Rio with the shoe and hit The Irish Curse for the pin. Del Rio had his foot on the ropes but the referee missed it as Sheamus pulled it off.</p>
<p>Your winner and still World champion, Sheamus!</p>
<p>Good stiff bout. I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of the finish but the work was good and this was a completely different match from everything that preceded it. This was way better than the entire storyline that set the bout up. WWE &lsquo;13 Fact: WWE &lsquo;13 will allow fans to not only customize characters to play WWE &lsquo;13 with but share those creations for others to download and use. So, if someone creates versions of Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman for themselves, you&rsquo;ll be able to import them for your own use.</p>

<p><strong>FULL BLOG FROM THE SUMMERSLAM PPV</strong></p>
<p>By Dave Scherer on 2012-08-19 20:10:22</p>
<p>They are starting off hour two of the show with The World Title match. Wow, that sure rates doesn&rsquo;t it? &hellip; In case I didn&rsquo;t mention this early, and maybe I didn&rsquo;t due to the fact that my mind was blurred with the stupidity of the booking, it wouldn&rsquo;t shock me to see Sheamus win and have Ziggler cash in MITB to prove to all of us that Dolph is a loser that can&rsquo;t win a fair fight.</p>
<p>They are starting off hour two of the show with The World Title match. Wow, that sure rates doesn&rsquo;t it? &hellip; In case I didn&rsquo;t mention this early, and maybe I didn&rsquo;t due to the fact that my mind was blurred with the stupidity of the booking, it wouldn&rsquo;t shock me to see Sheamus win and have Ziggler cash in MITB to prove to all of us that Dolph is a loser that can&rsquo;t win a fair fight. &hellip; ADR is in control early, dominating the action. He has gotten near falls and is working hard. Sheamus is selling well too. &hellip; Alberto slapped on the arm breaker and Sheamus did a great power spot to break it up. It got a lot of people in the crowd chanting for him. Sheamus got a two with White Noise. He set up for the Brogue Kick but ADR back up so he speared him and pounded his chest. Alberto came back with a kick to the head for a two. &hellip; For some reason, ADR attacked Ricardo. Bad move. They did the botched spot with Ricardo and Sheamus used the shoe to get the pin. Alberto got the pin, even though ADR&rsquo;s foot was on the rope. So, the face champ used the heel&rsquo;s gimmick AND pulled the heel&rsquo;s foot off the rope. Draw your own conclusions. &hellip; The match itself was very good.</p>

<p><strong>411’s WWE SummerSlam Report: 08.19.12</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Scott Slimmer on 08.19.2012</p>
<p>We are LIVE in beautiful Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>World Heavyweight Championship Match</p>
<p>Sheamus (Champion) vs. Alberto Del Rio w/ Ricardo Rodriguez</p>
<p>Sheamus muscles Del Rio to the ropes, but Del Rio swing him around and traps him in the corner. The action spills to the outside, and Sheamus and Del Rio beat each other all around ringside. Del Rio eventually rolls Sheamus back into the ring, but Sheamus traps Del Rio in the corner and works him over with a volley of punches. Del Rio reverses the positions and connects with a stiff kick to the back of the head, but Sheamus regains his wits and hits the rolling senton for a two count. Sheamus goes for the Celtic Cross, but he&rsquo;s too close to the corner and Del Rio escapes to the top turnbuckle. Sheamus tries to pull Del Rio back to the middle of the ring, but Del Rio exposes the top turnbuckle in the process. Sheamus goes for the Brogue Kick, but Del Rio ducks and kicks Sheamus out of the ring. Del Rio heads to the outside and whips Sheamus shoulder-first into the ring steps. Del Rio rolls Sheamus back into the ring and locks in a rear chin lock, but Sheamus tries to counter into a neck breaker, but Del Rio counters and kicks Sheamus in the back of the leg. Del Rio chokes Sheamus across the second rope, connects with a knee to the chest, and locks in a seated rear chin lock. Sheamus fights back to his feet and breaks the hold with a volley of head butts, but Del Rio drops Sheamus with a knee to the gut. Sheamus struggles to get back to his feet, but Del Rio lands a flying knee to the back of the head for a two count. Del Rio calls for the Brogue Kick to mock Sheamus, but Sheamus catches him with a double ax-handle. Del Rio whips Sheamus shoulder-first into the ring post, but Sheamus fights back with head butts from the ring apron. Sheamus heads up top, but Del Rio follows up him and hits a top rope flying arm breaker. Del Rio locks in the Cross Arm Breaker, but Sheamus rolls, lifts Del Rio, and counters into a powerbomb to break the hold. Sheamus hits White Noise, but Del Rio manages to kick out at two. Sheamus calls for the Brogue Kick, but Del Rio steps out of the way to avoid contact. Sheamus stretches Del Rio across the top rope and beats on his chest. Sheamus goes to work with mounted punches in the corner, but Del Rio drops Sheamus face-first onto the turnbuckle that was exposed earlier in the match. Del Rio rolls up Sheamus, but Sheamus kicks out at two. Rodriguez scampers into the ring and tosses his shoe to Del Rio, but Sheamus catches the shoe and nails Del Rio with it as the referee has his back turned and his attention focuses on Rodriguez. Sheamus hits Del Rio with the Irish Curse Backbreaker and gets the three count even though Del Rio definitely had his foot on the ropes. After the three count, Sheamus knocks Del Rio&rsquo;s foot off the ropes so that the referee never saw it was there. Not sure if that was a botched ending or not.</p>
<p>Match Result: Sheamus defeats Alberto Del Rio with the Irish Curse Backbreaker. Match Length: 12:00</p>

<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-06-08 21:56:05</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Columbia, South Carolina and your announcers are Booker ‘Spurier’ T, Josh ‘Ear Plugs’ Mathews, and Michael ‘Slow and Low’ Cole.</p>
<p>Booker asks Cole about what happened to him at the end of Raw against John Cena and Cole is not happy.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio makes his way to the ring but he is not introduced by the usual voice of Destiny.</p>
<p>Alberto tells everyone that just because he can, he wants to see what he did to Sheamus on Raw. We see the footage of Del Rio attacking Sheamus after Sheamus’ match.</p>
<p>Alberto has a smile on his face and he tells Sheamus that is a lesson for him. Sheamus said never trust a hooligan and he tells Sheamus not to mess with him because if Sheamus thought that was bad, at No Way Out, he is going to break his arm and then . . .</p>
<p>Sheamus’ music plays and he looks a lot shorter and trollish. It is Ricardus and Alberto has a laugh about it.</p>
<p>Alberto asks ‘Sheamus’ what he wants. Alberto wants to be honest with everyone and he tells the people that it is not Sheamus. Alberto says that anyone can be Sheamus.

Teddy says that per John, in the spirit of fairness, excitement, and people power, Kane will face Sheamus and Alberto Del Rio will face this man . . .</p>

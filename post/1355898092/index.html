<p><strong>SPOILERS WWE RAW Results For Next Monday</strong></p>
<p>By Raj Giri December 18, 2012</p>
<p>Because of the Christmas Holiday next week, WWE taped next Monday&rsquo;s episode of RAW after tonight&rsquo;s episode of SmackDown.</p>
<p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com readers Niki and Bobby Zynosky (@TheRealRZynosky) for sending in these results from tonight&rsquo;s tapings from the CONSOL Energy Center in Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
<p>Santa Claus was out to open RAW. Alberto Del Rio&rsquo;s music hit, and he came out and hit Santa with his BMW. Santa gave his thumbs up, so he&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>David Otunga comes out and talks about Santa Claus and Alberto Del Rio, and says that Del Rio was the victim. Zack Ryder came out and interrupted him and challenged Otunga to a match. Ryder pinned Otunga after a Rough Ryder.</p>
<p>John Cena vs. Alberto Del Rio in a &ldquo;Miracle on 34th Street&rdquo; match is up now. Ricardo cries for Santa while announcing Del Rio. Del Rio is beating on Cena with a mic saying that the wreck was an accident.</p>
<p>Cena turns the tables and opens a present to find a chair and hits ADR with it. They continue to open presents to find weapons, including a chair, a pie, a monitor, a bowling ball and a fire extinguisher. The match appears to be no-DQ, but nothing was announced. Del Rio hit Cena with the teddy bear to no avail. There was a &ldquo;use the tree&rdquo; chant and Cena hit ADR with a Christmas tree. Cena took the bowling ball and rolled it down the ramp between Del Rio&rsquo;s legs, and then does it a second time. He then takes the fire extinguisher and shoots it in Del Rio&rsquo;s face. Ricardo jumps on Cena&rsquo;s back, but Santa comes out and clubs Del Rio. Santa then took out a sock and gave Del Rio the mandible claw, which forced Del Rio to run into an AA from Cena. Santa is Mick Foley, I had no idea. Cena wins the match.</p>
<p>After the match, Santa Foley gave the &ldquo;bang bang&rdquo; taunt and gave Ricardo an action figure and a hug. He tired to give Del Rio his book and a couple of other items. Cena thanks the crowd for being there for the long night. Foley tells the crowd to &ldquo;have a nice holiDAY&rdquo; to end the show.</p>

<p><strong>COMPLETE CHRISTMAS EVE RAW SPOILERS FOR NEXT MONDAY</strong></p>
<p>By Mike Johnson on 2012-12-18 21:47:36</p>
<p>WWE began taping Raw for this Monday 12/24 following their Smackdown broadcast in Pittsburgh. David Jakielo sent the following:</p>
<p>*The Christmas Eve Raw opens with a vignette where Alberto Del Rio accidentally runs over Santa Claus, who was there as Guest Host. Santa was stretchered out.</p>
<p>Zack Ryder pinned David Otunga. Otunga cut a promo beforehand about the legalities of the Del Rio-Santa situation and how Del Rio was the true victim.</p>
<p>John Cena pinned Alberto Del Rio in a &ldquo;Miracle on 34th Street&rdquo; match where there were weapons hidden inside gift boxes. Ricardo cried about Santa during his introduction of Del Rio. The first package had a steel chair, which Cena used. Del Rio opened a box and it was a pie but Cena moved and Ricardo was nailed. Cena opened a gift and it was a TV monitor he used. Ricardo gave Del Rio a gift box but it had a teddy bear which he threw at Cena. Del Rio&rsquo;s reaction to all this made it pretty funny. Cena opened a gift that was a bowling ball and rolled it down the ramp and it nailed Del Rio between the legs, then did it again. A fire extinguisher was used. Santa Claus runs in and it&rsquo;s Mick Foley who uses Socko. After the match, they all throw out gifts to the crowd and Alberto is acting like a babyface.</p>

<p><strong>WWE NEWS: Raw TV SPOILERS 12/14 - complete results for next Monday&rsquo;s Christmas Eve episode</strong></p>
<p>Dec 18, 2012 - 11:37:49 PM</p>
<p>After the Super Smackdown TV taping ended, the Raw taping started for the Christmas Eve episode.</p>
<p>Raw SPOILERS 12/24</p>
<p>The ramp is decked out with Christmas trees and gifts. The show started with guest host Santa, and Del Rio &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; ran him over with his car! Santa gave a thumbs up on the way out.</p>
<p>They placed yellow crime scene police tape around Del Rio&rsquo;s car, which is still parked at stage side&hellip;</p>
<p>David Otunga cut a promo on his Harvard alumni status. As a lawyer, he wanted to opine about Del Rio running over Santa. He said Santa is guilty of trespassing, etc. Ryder interrupted Otunga and said they have a match.</p>
<p>Cena and Del Rio - who just kinda turned face - is being billed as the main event as the overall TV taping passes the four-hour mark.</p>
<p>Ricardo Rodriguez came out after John Cena crying about Santa. Kinda funny.</p>
<p>John Cena beat Alberto Del Rio in a Street Fight. The &ldquo;You Killed Santa&rdquo; chants aimed at Del Rio were back from earlier. A lot of back and forth campy humor in the ring with Cena and Del Rio using a microphone. Rodriguez broke up a pinfall for Del Rio as well. More of a silly Street Fight than anything. A pie was even introduced as a weapon gift-wrapped at ringside. Many of the gifts were used as weapons and this turned into one of the sillier Street Fights I&rsquo;ve ever witnessed. Definitely an attempt at a comedy style match. Teddy bears and pies were introduced. A &ldquo;Use the tree&rdquo; chant started. Cena hit Del Rio with a Christmas Tree and eventually rolled a bowling ball down the entrance ramp into Del Rio&rsquo;s crotch&hellip;twice! Eventually, a run-in occurred from Santa. Santa used Mr. Socko (didn&rsquo;t appear to be Foley, but hard to tell!). Cena then won with an AA.</p>
<p>Rodriguez hugged Santa post-match. Santa then gave gifts to Ricardo Rodriguez and Alberto Del Rio. This ended the taping.</p>

<p><strong>12/18 WWE Raw taping spoilers: Full coverage of the taping for the Christmas Eve edition (spoilers)</strong></p>
<p>Dec 18, 2012 - 08:37 PM</p>
<p>The guest host for Raw was Santa Claus, who was giving out gifts. Alberto Del Rio drove out and ran over Santa. An ambulance showed up to help Santa. Alberto was upset and there were chants of &ldquo;You Killed Santa.&rdquo; Santa was strapped to a gurney and was stretchered out. Kevin felt it was too close to the Jerry Lawler heart attack. Santa gave the thumbs up as he was being wheeled out&hellip;</p>
<p>David Otunga came out for a promo to speak about Santa and Alberto Del Rio. Otunga said Del Rio is the victim and Santa is at fault. Zack Ryder came out and they set up a match&hellip;</p>
<p>John Cena will face Alberto Del Rio in a Miracle on 34th Street Fight.</p>
<p>John Cena defeated Alberto Del Rio (w/Ricardo Rodriguez) in a Miracle on 34th Street Fight in 12:30. There were wreaths, Christmas trees, and presents around the ring. It was like WCW Uncensored. Del Rio grabbed a mic and said what happened to Santa was an accident and he wasn&rsquo;t trying to hurt him. Cena unwrapped a present at ringside and found a chair, which he struck Del Rio with.</p>
<p>Ricardo slid a present to Del Rio, but he unwrapped it and found a pie. He tried to use it, but Cena ducked. They fought up the ramp and Cena unwrapped a monitor, which he struck Del Rio with. Del Rio opened another gift and found a teddy bear. Vince McMahon had to be cracking up somewhere. Cena hit Ricardo with a wreath and a box.</p>
<p>Cena struck Del Rio with a tree. He unwrapped a bowling ball and rolled it into Del Rio&rsquo;s yam bag. He screwed up his first bowl, so he did a retake. Cena opened another gift and found a fire extinguisher, which he sprayed at Del Rio. Santa (Mick Foley) came out and hit Ricardo with a sack of toys. Cena hit the Attitude Adjustment on Del Rio and got the win.</p>
<p>Santa gave Del Rio and Ricardo gifts despite what happened to him. Cena said it&rsquo;s a Christmas miracle and it&rsquo;s about forgiveness. Cena thanked the fans and the crew. He and Foley wished everyone a Merry Christmas. They handed out gifts to fans to close out the show. Good night from Pittsburgh.</p>

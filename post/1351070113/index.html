<p>We begin this week’s show with a time line from last week’s show showing the Corre’s introduction, Teddy Long’s ‘accident’, and Corre’s attack on Edge.</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Cincinnati, Ohio and your announcers are Michael ‘I’m Going to Win the Royal Rumble’ Cole, Matt ‘I’m Going to win the Royal Rumble’ Striker, and Josh ‘Les Thatcher is going to win the Royal Rumble’ Mathews.</p>

He says that he has thirty nine fighters from around the world ready to fight him. He says it is going to be like a mini Royal Rumble. One fighter is going to come out and then every thirty seconds thereafter until he has eliminated all thirty nine men. Alberto calls for the first amigito to come out.</p>

<p>Vickie says that she will not have her show get out of control. Since they are all in the ring, we will have a tag match with Kofi Kingston and Rey Mysterio facing Kane and Alberto Del Rio.</p>

<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-08-10 21:58:28</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Houston, Texas and your announcers are Josh ‘Remember the Astrodome’ Mathews and Michael ‘I could beat Akeem Olajuwon one on one’ Cole.</p>
<p>Since we are in the home town of the General Manager, that means that Booker T is going to start things off and he makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Before Booker makes any announcements, he does the Spinaroonie.</p>
<p>Booker wants to know what’s up with the people of Houston. He says that it feels damn good to be in his home town. He mentions that this is his second week on the job and he tells Houston that he has a problem. Booker wants to show us footage from Raw when Sheamus stole Alberto Del Rio’s car while Del Rio was winning his match.</p>
<p>Booker laughs at what Sheamus did and he says that watching Alberto freak out makes him smile. Booker says that Sheamus crossed the line and Booker wants Sheamus to come out and apologize to Del Rio.</p>
<p>Sheamus’ music plays and he makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Sheamus gets a mic and he tells Booker that Alberto Del Rio stood in the ring last week and told him where he came from, grew up, and conducted himself, he did not deserve to be the World Champion. He says that Del Rio tried to take his dignity, so he took Del Rio’s car. He had a lot of fun checking out San Antonio and talking with the locals. He also enjoyed having some food in Alberto’s car.</p>
<p>Sheamus says that if you are going to do the crime, you have to do the time. Sheamus apologizes to Booker, the WWE Universe, and Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>Booker says that we are going to move on . . .</p>
<p>However, there is someone who does not want to move on. That man is Alberto Del Rio and he is accompanied by Ricardo Rodriguez. Alberto says that we are not leaving this behind us. Alberto reminds Booker that Sheamus stole his car. Sheamus is not a champion, he is just a peasant. He is a thief, thug, and criminal. Alberto says that he filed a report with the San Antonio police department.</p>
<p>Booker stops Alberto and tells him that if charges are brought against Sheamus, then he will be stripped of his title.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he does not care and when a World Champion acts like a common hooligan, it reflects on the General Manager. He tells Booker to do something and do it now. Alberto says that he is close to taking things into his own hands.</p>
<p>Sheamus tells Bertie to calm down. He has an idea about how to settle this. Sheamus says that they don’t wait until SummerSlam. He suggests that he defend the World Title tonight against Alberto.</p>
<p>Booker wants to get an answer from Alberto and Del Rio says that he is thinking about waiting to be ready for SummerSlam, but to hell with everything so let’s do it tonight.</p>
<p>Booker wants to know if a Sucka can dig this.</p>
<p>Match Number Six: Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) versus Sheamus for the World Championship</p>
<p>Before the match can start, the ‘authorities’ come to the ring and he tells them that he never filed the report. He wants them to leave. Del Rio says that he wants his title match. They get on the apron and surround Sheamus.</p>
<p>Del Rio smiles and he tells them to ‘go’. Sheamus takes care of the ‘authorities’ and it is now time for Sheamus and Del Rio. Sheamus runs Del Rio into the turnbuckles but Ricardo and the rest of ‘Houston’s finest’ swarm Sheamus and punch him.</p>
<p>Del Rio goes after Sheamus, who is down in the corner. They hold Sheamus for Alberto and Del Rio slaps Sheamus in the face twice. Del Rio with a step up enzuigiri to Sheamus and then Del Rio sends his co-conspirators away.</p>
<p>Del Rio yells at Sheamus and then he stands over Sheamus as he tries to get up. Del Rio with the cross arm breaker and then he releases it.</p>

<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: LAST MAJOR SHOW BEFORE HELL IN A (OR THE) CELL; TAG TITLE PARTICIPANTS IN SINGLES MATCHES; THE BARRAGE CONTINUES TO ROLL; SHOW AND SHEAMUS HAVE WORDS FOR EACH OTHER</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-10-26 22:00:21</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Providence, Rhode Island and your announcers are Josh ‘Can Cody claim rights to this state’ Mathews and John ‘After climbing the seven summits, I will swim the seven seas’ Layfield.</p>
<p>We begin listening to voices and Randy Orton makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>We see footage from the issues between Randy Orton and Alberto Del Rio from the last month that will be leading to their match at Hell in a Cell.</p>
<p>Randy says that he came out here tonight to set the record straight. Most people think that he despises Alberto Del Rio because he attacked him last week. It is not because he attacked him, it is why he attacked him. If Alberto had said that he was trying to get people to forget about how he is a miserable disappointment after failing against Sheamus. Del Rio attacked him while facing Big Show.</p>
<p>Alberto was not honest and he picked the wrong guy to make an example out of. Randy says that he will be honest with Alberto. On Sunday, he will give Alberto the most brutal beating of his life. Alberto likes to call himself the new Apex Predator of the WWE and that is his biggest lie.</p>
<p>Randy is interrupted by Alberto’s music and he comes out to the stage with Ricardo Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Alberto says that Randy is not very smart. They are going to do this on his terms, not Randy’s. In two days, at Hell in a Cell, he will show the world that Randy is not a viper. He is nothing like a garden snake and he can crush Randy at any time with his boot. Alberto says that he is the new Apex Predator in the WWE.</p>
<p>Randy says that he can understand Alberto, but if the people of Providence cannot understand him. He says that Alberto has big talk when he is not in the ring or when they are at a distance. He says that Alberto is a spineless, bottom feeder with no cajones.</p>
<p>Alberto asks Randy if he thinks he is afraid of him. Alberto says that Randy’s time is up. Ricardo has something to say to Alberto but Alberto does not move. Alberto backs up and he tells Randy not yet, but he will see him on Sunday.</p>
<p>Orton’s music plays and from out of nowhere, Wade Barrett attacks Randy from behind and connects with a forearm to the back and he leaves the ring.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We area back and Alberto and Ricardo are in the back. Teddy Long asks Alberto if he is happy with what happened and Alberto says that he had nothing to do with what happened to Orton.</p>
<p>Wade Barrett stops by and he asks Alberto if that is what he wanted.</p>
<p>Teddy says that you cannot play a playa. He is not fooling anybody. Teddy tells Wade that he will be facing Randy Orton tonight because that is what Booker T wants.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Three: Randy Orton versus Wade Barrett</strong></p>

Orton sends Barrett back into the ring and then he kicks Barrett in the leg and he does the Garvin Stomp. Orton with a kick to the ribs and then he runs his boots across the face.</p>

Barrett with a back heel kick that sends Orton to the floor.</p>
<p>Barrett sends Orton into the announce table and we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Barrett with a reverse chin lock. Orton with a head butt but Barrett with a knee to the midsection. Barrett chokes Orton in the ropes and Barrett with knees to Orton and then he connects with a running boot that forces Orton to the canvas. Barrett gets a near fall.

Orton looks around. Barrett with an Irish whip but Orton with a boot. Barrett with the Blackpool Slam for a near fall.</p>
<p>Barrett gets ready to give Orton a souvenir but Orton avoids it and he hits a back breaker. Barrett goes to the apron and Orton with the IEDDT. Orton looks around and he twist to the mat and he pounds the mat in anticipation of the RKO, but he sees Alberto Del Rio at ringside.</p>

<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: THE INTERCONTINENTAL TITLE IN THE SPOTLIGHT; THERE IS A PARTY GOING ON (AND YOU KNOW HOW IT WILL END); THE BATTLE FOR THE HEART AND SOUL OF KELLY KELLY CONTINUES</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2010-12-31 21:59:49</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Rochester, New York and your announcers are Matt ‘Happy’ Striker, Michael ‘New’ Cole, and Josh ‘Year’ Mathews.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Three: Edge and Rey Mysterio versus Kane and Alberto Del Rio</strong></p>
<p>Del Rio and Mysterio start things off and Alberto with kicks followed by an Irish whip but Del Rio runs into a boot from Rey. Rey with a head scissors that sends Alberto into the ropes and Edge is tagged in. Edge punches Alberto and kicks him in the corner. Edge with a kick as he comes off the ropes and he clotheslines Alberto over the top rope to the floor. Kane comes in and Edge punches him and then Edge and Rey with a double drop kick that sends Kane to the floor next to Del Rio. Edge propels Rey over the top rope to the floor in a modified wheelbarrow power bomb. We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Kane and Del Rio are in control of the match and Kane with an uppercut to Edge followed by punches. Edge punches Kane and then sends him into the turnbuckles. Edge climbs onto the ropes and Edge punches Kane but the referee deals with Rey on the apron and Del Rio drops Edge on the top rope.</p>
<p>Del Rio tags back in and he kicks Edge followed by a snap mare and drop kick to the back for a near fall. Del Rio with a kick to the head and he gets a near fall. Del rio chokes Edge in the ropes and Kane with a boot to the head while Del Rio talks to the referee. Del Rio gets a near fall. Kane tags back in and he kicks Edge in the ribs. Kane with more kicks to the ribs and then he chokes Edge with the rope. Kane gets a near fall on Edge. Kane with an Irish whip but he runs into a boot. Edge with an Edge-o-Matic and he tags Rey into the match. Rey with a seated splash from the top turnbuckle followed by a drop kick to the knee and a kick to the head. Rey knocks Del Rio off the apron but that gives Kane enough time to recover and he punches Rey when Rey returns his focus to the legal man in the match.</p>
<p>Rey with a kick to Kane and then he tries for a springboard cross body but Kane with an uppercut to Rey. Kane throws Rey to the floor and Del Rio kicks Rey while Kane distracts the referee. Kane Irish whips Rey into the ringside barrier and then he punches Rey before returning to the ring. Kane gets a near fall. Del Rio tags back in and he gets a running start before kicking Rey in the head and he gets a near fall. Del Rio with a gut buster from the shoulders for a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a figure four body scissors but Rey gets out of the hold. Rey with a kick to the head and a back kick. Del Rio stops Rey’s momentum with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker for a near fall. Kane tags back in and he kicks Rey and Irish whips Rey and hits a back breaker and then he stretches Rey on his knee. Rey with punches and then he kicks Kane when he charges into the ring. Rey hits a tilt-a-whirl DDT as a counter and both men are down.</p>
<p>Del Rio and Edge tag in and Edge with a running forearm and clothesline followed by a flapjack. Del Rio has Edge on his shoulders but Edge escapes and counters with an Impaler DDT. Edge has that look in his eyes and he pulls at the hair to signify that the spear is coming. Del Rio gets back to his feet but Kane stops the spear attempt and grabs Edge by the throat. Edge escapes the choke slam and he sends Kane across the ring and Rey pulls down the ropes and Kane goes to the floor.</p>
<p>Edge with a baseball slide to Kane and Rey with a head scissors that sends Del Rio into the ropes for the 619 and then Edge finishes off Del Rio with a spear and he gets the three count.</p>
<p>Winners: Edge and Rey Mysterio</p>
<p>Edge and Rey celebrate in the ring and then we go back to the party.</p>
<p>Chavo is talking to Kaitlyn and Chavo comments on how lame the party is but he knows how to liven it up. Chavo thinks that he is going to inhale helium from the balloons, but his voice does not change and Kaitlyn tells Chavo that there is no helium in the balloons. Chavo can’t believe that and walks away. We see the return of the Chris Masters Pectacular and he is watching Hornswoggle try out but he does not have the same technique as Masters, but Hornswoggle leaves with Kaitlyn.</p>
<p>Big Show is telling Kelly that she is a big girl and she can make her own decisions, but since they are BFFs, he warns Kelly about Drew. He tells her to be careful. Kelly thanks Show for the advice.</p>
<p>Cody Rhodes steps up to the Resolution mic and he says that he has an announcement. Cody wants to know how, as the face of Smackdown, that he can go on with Big Show trying to break his nose. Good thing Big Show is standing right next to Cody so he can respond. Show tells Cody that is his first mistake because if he wanted to break his nose, it would be broken.</p>
<p>Teddy interjects and says that the party every year seems to end up having a fight. Show says that it wouldn’t be much of a fight but Teddy does his job preventing a fight . . . so far. Teddy says that after what he saw in the ring, he wants to announce two matches for the first Smackdown of 2011. Alberto Del Rio will face Rey Mysterio in a two-out-of-three falls match. Kane will face Edge for the World Title in a Last Man Standing Match.</p>

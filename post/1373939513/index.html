<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-07-15 21:33:59</p>
<p>With Money in the Bank out of the way, we are on the road to SummerSlam in Los Angeles. Randy Orton and Damien Sandow are one step closer to becoming the WWE and World Champions respectively. What was the meaning of the betrayals on Sunday night and are they a one time things or have friendships been severed? What will Brad Maddox do on his first full night in charge? Let’s hope he gives a State of the Maddox Address.</p>
<p>We are in Brooklyn, New York and your announcers are John ‘JCL’ Layfield, Michael ‘We’re all staying at Johnson’s house’ Cole, and Jerry ‘I just got done writing Brad Maddox’s promo’ Lawler.</p>
<p>We begin with the man who is going to revolutionize Monday nights, Brad Maddox. Brad thanks everyone for their reaction. This is the first time that Raw has been in Brooklyn and this is the start of the Maddox era. Brad says that we will have a rematch tonight. Alberto Del Rio will face Dolph Ziggler.</p>
<p>The announcers talk about the match between Dolph Ziggler and Alberto Del Rio from last night and we see photos of AJ’s interference.</p>
<p>Dolph Ziggler is walking in the back and AJ tries to talk to him. She says that she knows that he is mad at her. Dolph tells AJ to stop apologizing. AJ is relieved to hear that and she hugs Dolph but Dolph does not hug back.</p>
<p>Dolph says that it is time for him to move on.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Two: Alberto Del Rio versus Dolph Ziggler in a Non Title Match</strong></p>
<p>Del Rio with a kick to the leg and forearms to the back. Ziggler with a drop kick for a near fall. Ziggler with a neck breaker followed by the rapid fire series of elbow drops and then he spins around for the tenth and connects with a leaping elbow drop and he gets a near fall. Del Rio moves when Ziggler goes for a splash in the corner.</p>
<p>Del Rio with kicks. Del Rio puts Ziggler on the turnbuckles and he goes for an inverted superplex and he hits it and gets a near fall. Del Rio chokes Ziggler and the referee warns him. Del Rio chokes Ziggler in the ropes. Ziggler with a splash into the corner and then he hits a flying clothesline.</p>
<p>Ziggler with a kick but Del Rio with a back body drop and Ziggler goes over the top rope to the floor.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Del Rio with a reverse chin lock but Ziggler with punches. Del Rio with punches followed by a belly-to-back suplex. Del Rio waits for Ziggler to get back to their feet and Del Rio sets for a super kick but Ziggler moves. Del Rio sends Ziggler into the air and then he stomps on the head. Del Rio tries for the running enzuigiri in the corner but Ziggler knows what was coming and he hits a DDT to counter and he gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Ziggler punches Del Rio and Del Rio punches back. Del Rio with a punch to the head and Ziggler goes down. Del Rio goes for a splash in the ropes but Ziggler moves. Del Rio is able to hold onto the ropes and he gets on the ropes but Ziggler with a drop kick and Del Rio gets his foot on the rope to stop the count.</p>
<p>Ziggler misses the Fameasser and Del Rio with a German suplex and bridge for a near fall. Del Rio with head butts to Ziggler. Del Rio sets for the cross arm breaker but he takes too long and Ziggler counters with a neck breaker and he gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Ziggler is sent into the turnbuckles and Del Rio with a step up enzuigiri for a near fall. Del Rio puts Ziggler in the tree of woe and he kicks Ziggler. Del Rio goes for a shoulder on Ziggler but Ziggler pulls himself up and Del Rio hits the ring post with his shoulder.</p>
<p>Ziggler goes to the turnbuckles and he hits a Fameasser for a near fall but the bell rings and we see that it was AJ but the referee tells them to continue the match. Del Rio with a super kick while Ziggler yells at AJ and Del Rio gets the three count.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>After the match, AJ stares at Dolph and she comes into the ring with that ‘I need one of those jackets that tie in the back’ looks. AJ hits Ziggler and Ziggler tries to walk away from her. From out of nowhere, Big E Langston hits Ziggler with a running body block. Langston gives Ziggler the Big Ending.</p>
<p>AJ kneels down and rubs Ziggler’s head before picking him up and dropping him back to the mat.</p>
<p>We are back and Paul Heyman will be on MizTV on Smackdown on Friday night.</p>
<p>The wrestlers are on the stage and everyone waiting to see if they will be picked to be John Cena’s opponent at SummerSlam.</p>
<p>John says that it is time for him to announce his opponent for SummerSlam. John says that he cannot do that because he hasn’t made his decision yet. All night, he has listened to Superstar after Superstar after Superstar tell him why they should face him at SummerSlam. John says that he is waiting for the most important voice in the WWE, the WWE Universe.</p>
<p>Their voice is so important because their toughness is honesty and he respects that. He wants a match that the people want to see. He asks them to look at the Superstars on the stage and he mentions some names and he wants their reactions.</p>
<p>The members of 3MB get shot down. Randy Orton gets a mixture of applause and boos. He asks about The Great Khali and he gets more boos than cheers. He asks about Alberto Del Rio and they boo him. He asks about Chris Jericho and they like that idea. Then he asks about Rob Van Dam. Cena asks about Fandango and they are mixed on him. He asks about Sheamus and the people are not swell on the fella.</p>
<p>Cena asks about Ryback and the crowd makes him want to cry again. Cena asks if he is forgetting anyone.</p>
<p>John says that he has made his selection. It is someone who deserves this opportunity. The crowd chants for Daniel Bryan.</p>
<p>Cena says that if he accepts the challenge, he selects Daniel Bryan. Daniel Bryan bounds to the ring. Bryan gets in the ring and he yeses in John Cena’s face and we go to credits.</p>

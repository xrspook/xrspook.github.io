<p><strong>COMPLETE WWE RAW 1014 REPORT: SURVIVOR SERIES MAIN EVENT ANNOUNCED; AJ IS BACK BUT SOMEONE IS FIRED; A FEW TAG TEAM MATCHES; A SMACKDOWN REMATCH; A HUGE DONATION FROM THE WWE FOR CANCER RESEARCH; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-10-29 20:10:23</p>
<p>The show starts with footage from Hell in a Cell, when referee Brad Maddox gave Ryback a low blow to help CM Punk win the match and retain the title. We then see a photo of Ryback giving CM Punk the marching muscle buster on top of the cell.</p>
<p>We are live from Charlotte, North Carolina and your announcers are Jim ‘Did someone mention what happened in the Notre Dame/Oklahoma game during Hell in a Cell’ Ross and Michael ‘Where are the Tony Chimmel guys’ Cole.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Nine: Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) versus Justin Gabriel</strong></p>
<p>Del Rio with a kick and he sends Gabriel into the turnbuckles and kicks him some more. Del Rio with a suplex for a near fall. Del Rio with a snap mare and kick for a near fall. Gabriel with a monkey flip and Gabriel with a clothesline from the turnbuckles and he gets a near fall. Gabriel with a head scissors to Del Rio and then he sends Del Rio back into the ring.</p>
<p>Del Rio kicks Gabriel to the apron and then works on the injured elbow in the ropes and he gets a near fall. Del Rio with a key lock. Gabriel with punches but Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker for a near fall. Del Rio with a kick to the back. Del Rio works on Gabriel’s elbow and then Del Rio with a belly-to-back suplex for another near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio with another key lock on Gabriel. Gabriel with punches but Del Rio sends Gabriel back to the mat. Del Rio with a leaping boot to the head and then he kicks Gabriel again. Del Rio with another near fall and then he returns to the key lock. Gabriel with elbows and he avoids a tilt-a-whirl back breaker. Gabriel with kicks to Del Rio followed by a drop kick. Gabriel with a quebrada for a near fall.</p>
<p>Gabriel misses a splash into the turnbuckles and Del Rio with the step up enzuigiri. Del Rio signals for and applies the cross arm breaker and Gabriel taps out.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>We are back and Paul Heyman is in the ring and he says that he is honored to introduce the man who is the WWE Champion, the man on the cover of WWE 13, and the man who is the Best in the World. He brings out CM Punk.</p>
<p>We see the cover of WWE 13 over the ring. Paul says that CM Punk is the greatest WWE Champion of all time. Paul says that when Punk asked him to put together Team Punk, he is here to do so at the behest of the World Champion.</p>
<p>The first man is a reality star and a movie star. He is a former WWE and Intercontinental Champion. He brings out The Miz.</p>
<p>The next people are a future Tag Team Championship team and the next tag team champions. He brings out Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow.</p>
<p>The final man on the team is someone who could be his co-captain. Paul introduces Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>CM Punk tells everyone to shut up and listen to someone who knows what he is talking about. It is going to be a celebration at Survivor Series. It will be a celebration of one year as champion. What better way to take a delusional and disrespectful so called legend and put him out of his misery. Punk says that Foley wants the spotlight but Foley’s time is gone. The spotlight that he craves will cost him the final two teeth in his head. He teaches Foley respect and how to survive at Survivor Series.</p>
<p>Mick Foley makes his way to the ring. If Punk wants to talk about survival. Is what happened last night ‘surviving’? Foley calls it weaseling. He weaseled his way into retaining and then out of the ring tonight. He has no problem referring to Punk as the champion, but he has trouble calling Punk a man. A legend does not recruit a crooked referee.</p>
<p>Punk says that he had nothing to do with the official last night. Punk wants to see Foley’s team.</p>
<p>Foley says that he has a team. He says that he would walk to the Gates of Hell with this team. First is Kofi Kingston. He has a team, the Tag Team Champions, Kane and Daniel Bryan. The next member is someone who does not like Foley, but it is someone who dislikes the members of Team Punk more. That man is Randy Orton.</p>
<p>Punk says that is a hell of a team. They are all champions in their own rights. Punk says that their goal is to eliminate Kofi, Randy, and those two to get it down to Mick Foley to show what it is like to be a champion.</p>
<p>Foley says that is a great plan, but Foley is not the weak link of the team because he is not competing. Foley introduces the final man and it is Ryback.</p>
<p>Eight of the men battle in the ring while Pun waits for Ryback and then Punk leaves the ring. Ryback stands in the center of the ring while there are four battles around him.</p>
<p>Punk holds his title belt over his head as he stares at Ryback. Ryback with a lariat and Shellshock.</p>

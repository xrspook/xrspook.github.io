<p>F <strong>ULL PPV THOUGHTS: THE OVER THE LIMIT BLOG</strong></p>
<p>By Dave Scherer on 2012-05-20 19:58:11</p>
<p>Orton got the biggest pop. &hellip; I thought I heard Lilian say that Sheamus weighed 227 pounds. I am watching live so I can&rsquo;t rewind. If she did, someone f&rsquo;d up. &hellip; The heels were in control early on, until Jericho kicked Alberto. Now it&rsquo;s every man for himself. &hellip; Booker just said that Alberto looks like he has been hitting the gym. Cole smartly pointed out like all four of the guys in the match look that way. I am changing the saying. It is now, &ldquo;There is no cure for Booker&rdquo;. &hellip; Early on, they are all getting their stuff in. I expect this will get some time. &hellip; They are doing the bit where it&rsquo;s mostly two guys in the ring while two guys sell on the floor. The two right now are Orton and Sheamus, but Alberto came in and attacked Orton. Sheamus rolled out. Jericho came in an attacked Alberto. Orton rolled out. Now it&rsquo;s party time. &hellip; Orton is bleeding from the bridge of his nose. More unwanted color for WWE. &hellip; Out of nowhere, Jericho puts the Walls on Alberto, which left him open for a Sheamus kick. But,<br>
Jericho knew that and ducked it and hit the Codebreaker. &hellip; Cole uses that moment to push some article about whether Jericho should have never come back on WWE.com. Yeah, that is what I want to wonder during a title match I paid big money to see, if one of the guys in it belongs. There is no cure for WWE creative. &hellip; Out of nowhere Orton gets a two count on Jericho. Sheamus hits the Brogue kick on Orton and gets a two when Jericho breaks it up. So, Sheamus hit White Noise on Jericho to retain. I guess WWE.com was right about Y2J. &hellip; Anyway, it was a good match once it got going, the first one on the show. &hellip; Booker just said it had to have gone 35 to 40 minutes. So the English language isn&rsquo;t the only thing he is clueless about. Add telling time to that. &hellip; Orton isn&rsquo;t happy. Looks like we have a face vs. face feud coming for the World Title.</p>

<p><strong>411’s Instant Access 05.20.12: WWE Over The Limit 2012</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Scott Slimmer on 05.21.2012</p>
<p>Fatal Four-Way Match for the World Heavyweight Championship<br>
Sheamus (Champion) vs. Randy Orton vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. Chris Jericho</p>
<p>Match Result: Sheamus defeats Chris Jericho with White Noise.<br>
Match Length: 15:52<br>
Match Analysis:<br>
Slimmer: This match was frantic bordering on chaotic, but it was also a ton of fun. There was literally never a dull moment throughout the entire match, and all four guys did a great job of keeping the action going nonstop from bell to bell. The last three or four minutes of the match were just on onslaught of finisher after finisher after finisher, and I loved it all. Having Sheamus pick up the win was the right decision, because there&rsquo;s no reason to kill his momentum so early into his first run with the belt as a face. Sheamus will be one of WWE&rsquo;s top stars over the course of the next half decade, and he needs a strong title run to establish him as such. There will undoubtedly be those who question the decision to have Jericho eat the pin, and they will claim that this further proves that Jericho&rsquo;s most recent return has been a failure. I tend to believe that the whole point of Jericho&rsquo;s return was to put over the next generation of stars and have great matches, and by those criteria his return has been remarkably successful. Going forward, my guess is that Jericho will fade out of title contention. That will leave Orton and Del Rio as the top contenders for Sheamus&rsquo; title. Del Rio will probably get a title shot next, but my guess is that we&rsquo;re building toward a title match between Sheamus and Orton at SummerSlam.<br>
Match Rating:<br>
Slimmer: ****</p>

<p><strong>WWE over the Limit 2012 Results: Sheamus Retains World Title over Jericho, Orton, Del Rio</strong></p>
<p>By Big Nasty (Featured Columnist) on May 20, 2012</p>
<p>Orton and Sheamus were the focus of this match early as Sheamus got the better of Orton. Jericho low-bridged Orton as the match moved to the outside.</p>
<p>After Sheamus was thrown into the announce desk, heels Jericho and Del Rio reentered the ring to prey on Orton.</p>
<p>Orton fought off the heels early, but they quickly double teamed Orton. The temporary alliance between Jericho and Del Rio quickly faded as Del Rio hit a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker on Jericho.</p>
<p>Orton capitalized on the dissension, but walked into an Enzuigiri by Jericho.</p>
<p>Sheamus finally reentered the match as he opened up his offensive playbook on Del Rio. As Sheamus teased the Brogue Kick, a distraction from Ricardo Rodriguez lead to an Enzuigiri by Del Rio.</p>
<p>Sheamus recovered with a comeback on Del Rio, capped off by a British Bulldog-style power slam for a nearfall.</p>
<p>Del Rio battled back, hitting a dropkick to Sheamus&rsquo; head for a nearfall. A missed dropkick lead to Sheamus&rsquo; patented ten-count chest punches. Sheamus&rsquo; punches were interrupted by Jericho, which brought out Randy Orton, who cleaned house.</p>
<p>As Orton pounded the mat, preparing for the RKO, Del Rio caught Orton in the cross arm breaker. The move was broken up by Jericho.</p>
<p>A Lionsault from Jericho was met by knees to the stomach. Jericho was dumped outside of the ring, which lead to Sheamus and Orton countering each others&rsquo; finishers until Sheamus rolled up Orton for a two count.</p>

<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: REY RETURNS TO THE RING; DOES DOLPH CASH IN THE BRIEFCASE?; IS CHRISTIAN TRYING TO BE THE BEST MAN IN THE WEDDING OF THE CENTURY OF THE YEAR OF NEXT WEEK?; SANDOW SAVES US</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-07-20 21:59:56</p>
<p>We are live on tape from San Diego, California and your announcers are Booker ‘My fave 619’ T, Josh ‘Maybe I can be smuggled over the boarder to be with better announcers’ Mathews, and Michael ‘Why aren’t the people liking my San Diego Clippers gear’ Cole.</p>
<p>We begin with Rey Mysterio, who makes his way to the ring in his home town.</p>
<p>We see footage from Rey’s return on Monday night to attack Alberto Del Rio and hit the 619 on the man of destiny.</p>
<p>Rey says that it has almost been a year that he was injured and it took place in this arena. He says that he never lost hope. Now it feels good to be back with all of his friends, family, and his people in his home town to officially say that he is back.</p>
<p>He couldn’t wait so he came back on Raw. Because Alberto Del Rio was in the ring, it made things sweeter. He says that he has to admit . . .</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio’s music interrupts Rey and Alberto comes out dressed quite dapper with Ricardo Rodriguez. Alberto welcomes back the Chihuahua. He tells Rey that he made a mistake coming back because he never should have picked a fight against him. The people might not remember, but Rey remembers that Alberto took him out a year ago and almost ended his career.</p>
<p>Alberto makes it to the ring and he says that he could finish the job right now. Alberto gives Rey an order instead. He tells Rey to leave his ring right now.</p>
<p>Rey says that he ain’t going nowhere.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he has everything. He has the money, the power, and the titles. Alberto wants to talk about what Sheamus did at Money in the Bank.</p>
<p>Rey tells Alberto that Sheamus beat Alberto’s face in at Money in the Bank.</p>
<p>Alberto tells Rey that he hasn’t learned anything, but Rey’s return will be short. Lucky for Rey, the one who will destroy Rey’s life and career is none other than the next World Champion Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>That brings out Dolph Ziggler, Vickie Guerrero, and their love child known as the Money in the Bank briefcase. Dolph says that if the next World Champion is going to ruin Rey’s career, it will be due to him. Dolph tells Rey it is his lucky day because he isn’t out here for Rey. He is out here for Alberto.</p>
<p>Dolph mentions that he defeated seven other people to win the briefcase and earn the title match. He was going to cash it in on Sunday but due to Alberto, he is not the champion.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he does not work for Dolph and he will not do the dirty job for Dolph to help him out. Alberto says that Dolph could be working for him along with his burra.</p>
<p>Rey wants to bring the discussion back and he tells Dolph and Alberto if the ladies want to settle things, they should shut up and take care of each other.</p>
<p>Dolph agrees with Rey but he says that they shouldn’t deal with each other.</p>
<p>Before Alberto or Dolph can do anything to Rey, Sheamus’ music plays and they forget that he has to walk to the ring so they stop their attempt to attack Rey.</p>
<p>Sheamus tells Rey that it is so good to see him, fella. Sheamus tells Dolph if he makes another step, he will send him into the Pacific Ocean. Sheamus suggests they do something right now.</p>
<p>Dolph is ready for a fight, but Alberto leaves the ring. Sheamus with a running double sledge and Dolph falls into the ropes. Since Rey did not send him into the ropes, Dolph is not stuck in the ropes. Dolph is able to avoid the 619 and he goes to the floor and leaves.</p>
<p>We are back and the tag match has been made with Sheamus and Rey Mysterio facing Dolph Ziggler and Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>We go to the back and Vickie yells at Ricardo for Alberto calling her a burro. They argue back and forth. Ricardo says that Vickie is jealous of Alberto because Alberto is Mexican royalty. Vickie says that she is a better manager and Ricardo tells Vickie that he is a ring announcer. Ricardo leaves and Vickie screams.</p>
<p>Match Number Five: Dolph Ziggler and Alberto Del Rio with Vickie Guerrero and Ricardo Rodriguez versus Sheamus and Rey Mysterio</p>
<p>Dolph and Sheamus start things off and Ziggler with a waist lock but Sheamus with a take down to escape. They lock up again and Sheamus with a side head lock take down into a side head lock. Sheamus with a shoulder tackle but Ziggler with a drop kick. Ziggler with punches but Sheamus gets Ziggler on his shoulders. Ziggler with elbows. Sheamus with a rolling fireman’s carry slam and gets a near fall. The fans want Rey and Sheamus obliges.</p>
<p>Rey with a springboard leg drop for a near fall. Rey with a kick to the midsection but Dolph with an Irish whip. Rey gets his boots up but Ziggler stops Rey with a drop kick. Del Rio tags in and he kicks Rey in the midsection and gets a near fall. Rey with a kick and he tries to tag in Sheamus but Del Rio stops him momentarily.</p>
<p>Sheamus tags in and Ziggler does to. Sheamus with an elbow to Ziggler as Del Rio stays on the floor. Sheamus sends Ziggler to the apron and he sets for the forearms across the chest and we count to ten. Ziggler falls to the floor and Sheamus goes after him. Sheamus rolls Ziggler back in and he looks at Del Rio and that distraction allows Ziggler to recover and drop kick Sheamus. Del Rio with a kick on the floor and we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Ziggler with a reverse chin lock but Sheamus tosses Ziggler away and both men are down. Rey tags in and he hits a seated senton splash followed by a tilt-a-whirl head scissors. Ziggler with a kick to Rey and then Ziggler with a sunset flip but you do not sunset flip Rey because he rolls through and kicks Ziggler in the head.</p>
<p>Rey with a near fall. Ziggler with a knee and he tries for a slam but Rey with a drop kick to the knee and guess where Ziggler falls. Del Rio with a kick to the back and Booker wonders if we saw it. Ziggler with a Fameasser while Sheamus goes after Del Rio. The referee is out of position and Ziggler yells at him. Rey is able to kick out at two.</p>
<p>Del Rio tags in and Dolph kicks Rey in the knee and Del Rio gets a near fall. Del Rio with a rear chin lock. Rey with kicks to the head to get free but Rey is caught by Del Rio and Alberto with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker for a near fall. Ziggler tags in and he chokes Rey in the ropes.

Rey sends Del Rio over the top rope to the floor. Ziggler tags in and he keeps Rey from tagging in. Ziggler with a forearm. Ziggler tries for a power slam but Rey counters with a tornado DDT when Ziggler gets too cocky.</p>
<p>Del Rio and Sheamus tag in and Sheamus with running double sledges followed by a shoulder in the corner. Del Rio with a kick to the shoulder and then he tries for the float over but Sheamus sends Del Rio into Ziggler. Sheamus hits White Noise and then Sheamus looks around and gets ready for the Brogue Kick.</p>
<p>Ricardo grabs Sheamus’ leg and the referee calls for the bell.</p>
<p>Winners: Sheamus and Rey Mysterio by disqualification</p>
<p>After the match, Del Rio with a round kick to the head and Del Rio applies the cross arm breaker. Officials pull Del Rio off Sheamus.</p>
<p>Dolph asks Vickie for the briefcase and he thinks about cashing it in again.</p>
<p>Ziggler hands the case to the referee but Rey Mysterio attacks Ziggler and Ziggler falls into the ropes. Rey hits the 619 and then Dolph bounces up and gets nailed with a Brogue Kick.</p>

<p><strong>411’s WWE Smackdown Report 7.20.12</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Larry Csonka on 07.20.2012</p>
<p>Josh Matthews, Booker T and Michael Cole welcome us to the show, we&rsquo;re in San Diego.</p>
<p>Rey Mysterio makes his way to kick off the show. We see footage of Ray&rsquo;s return to Raw on Monday. Mysterio soaks in the crowd reaction and states that it has been almost a year since he was injured in this very arena. He never lost hope and he is happy to be here with friends and family in his hometown. He couldn&rsquo;t wait to come back and had to return on Raw, and since Del Rio was in the ring, it made his return sweet.</p>
<p>Del Rio now makes his way to the ring with Ricardo. Del Rio calls him a Chihuahua and says Mysterio never should have picked a fight with him. He then mentions that he almost ended Rey&rsquo;s career, and he could finish the job right now. But instead, he will order Mysterio to leave the ring right now. Mysterio says no, and Del Rio says he did it all while Mysterio was gone, and now, Del Rio wants to address Sheamus. Mysterio reminds Del Rio that Sheamus kicked his ass at the PPV. Del Rio says he is glad he is back, because it will be a short return. Del Rio promises to end Mysterio, and then…</p>
<p>Dolph Ziggler and Vickie Guerrero make their way to the ring. Ziggler then says he is the next world champion, and mentions that he is not here for Mysterio, he is here for Del Rio. Ziggler says he won MITB, and he gets a world title match whenever he wants it. He was about to cash in last Sunday, and he would have been champion if it wasn&rsquo;t for Del Rio. Del Rio says he doesn&rsquo;t work for Ziggler, and won&rsquo;t do his dirty work. Del Rio says that he could have Ziggler and his burro working for him. They look to fight and Rey attempts to egg them on, and Ziggler agrees. He and Del Rio back down Rey and…</p>
<p>Sheamus is out to even the odds. He and Rey shake hands, and Shamus says it is good to see Mysterio. And as for Ziggler and Del Rio, if they take one more step, he will take them out. They prepare to battle, and Del Rio bails. Sheamus levels Ziggler, Mysterio goes for a 619, but Ziggler bails.</p>
<p>The main event will be Rey and Sheamus vs. Ziggler and Del Rio.</p>
<p>Vickie and Ricardo argue backstage. Ricardo says that Del Rio is Mexican Royalty, and that Vickie came across the river on a canoe. Vickie ends up screaming wildly.</p>
<p>More Raw hype, they&rsquo;re going to three hours you know.</p>
<p>Ricardo announced Del Rio, and as Del Rio&rsquo;s music played, Vickie interrupted to introduce the &ldquo;star&rdquo; of the team, Dolph Ziggler.</p>
<p>We get a replay of Ziggler&rsquo;s interaction with Chris Jericho from Monday.</p>
<p>Sheamus and Rey Mysterio vs. Alberto Del Rio and Dolph Ziggler</p>
<p>Sheamus and Ziggler to begin things. Sheamus works his power game and controls Ziggler early. Shoulder block by Sheamus, off the ropes and he then eats a dropkick. Sheamus battles back, hits the kamikaze roll for 2. Tag to Rey, lays the boots to Ziggler. Off the ropes and a boot by Rey. Off the ropes and Ziggler decapitates Rey with a clothesline, and covers for 2. Tag to Del Rio, who lays the boots to the ribs and covers for 2. Rey fights back, tags Sheamus and he chases Del Rio to the floor. Sheamus ties Ziggler up in the ropes and proceeds to beat his chest in with clubbing shots. Sheamus follows Ziggler to the floor, tosses him back in and as Sheamus tries to enter the ring, Ziggler lands a dropkick and sends him back to the floor. Del Rio drops down and kicks him in the head, ad we head to a commercial @ 4:00.</p>
<p>Back from commercial @ 7:00 as Sheamus tries to fight back against Ziggler. Makes the tag to Rey, flies in with the Thez press. Head scissors follows. Charges in on Ziggler, but then rolls through a sunset flip and kicks Ziggler in the face, cover gets 2. Rey with the dropkick to the knee of Ziggler, looks for the 619 but Del Rio Kicks Rey in the back to slow him down, allowing Ziggler to clothesline Rey and cover for 2. Tag to Del Rio, kicks to Rey again and then works a chinlock with the knee in the back of Rey. Knees by Rey, fights out, off the ropes and a tilt a whirl back breaker by Del Rio gets 2. Tag to Ziggler, who continues t work over Rey and keep him grounded. Rey again tries to fight to his feet, neck breaker by Ziggler and a tag to Del Rio. Rey playing Ricardo Morton here, diving for a tag now, but Del Rio cuts him off. Rey manages to dump Del Rio to the floor, Rey looking for the tag, but Del Rio manages to tag in Ziggler and he stops Rey from tagging in Sheamus. Rey counters a slam with a tornado DDT, and BOTH men are down. Tags to Del Rio and Sheamus. Sheamus cleans house for a bit, but then lams Del Rio into Ziggler. White Noise connects for Sheamus. Looks for the brogue kick, but Ricardo grabs him foot, and that will lead to the DQ.</p>
<p>OFFICIAL RESULT: Sheamus and Rey Mysterio @ 13:00 via DQ RATING: ***</p>
<p>After the match Del Rio gets the arm bar on Sheamus, and referees had to run down and break things up. Del Rio and Ricardo bail, and Ziggler contemplates cashing in since the arm bar had hurt Sheamus. So of course as he is about to hand over the case, he eats a 619 and the 973rd brogue kick of 2012. Sheamus and Rey stand tall.</p>
<p>End scene.</p>

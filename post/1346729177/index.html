<p><strong>411&rsquo;s Instant Analysis 09.03.12: WWE Monday Night Raw</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Chad Nevett on 09.04.2012</p>
<p>SEGMENT THIRTEEN: Falls Count Anywhere Match - John Cena vs. Alberto Del Rio Match Result: Alberto Del Rio pinned John Cena Match Length: A little over 13 minutes (shown)</p>
<p>At first, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much from this match. It seemed like they were content to work a regular match and stick to the ring. But, their excursion from the ring added a lot as they built up to bigger and bigger spots, had a lot of back-and-forth and teased the finish well for the final five or six minutes. Del Rio&rsquo;s mid-match mic rant was a nice touch and I&rsquo;d like to see him do that more. It suits his character well. The finish itself was somewhat obvious (that or Sheamus getting involved) and would have worked better in a regular match, not as the finish to a stipulations match like this where it ending cleanly would have been nice. Another time, another place, I guess.</p>
<p>Rating: 8.0 out of 10</p>
<p>Segment of the Night: The Falls Count Anywhere Match</p>
<p>Trash Segment of the Night: Kaitlyn vs. Eve</p>
<p>Final Analysis: A solid show, but without any really strong segment to anchor things like the last few weeks. It was a much more even show without any high highs or low lows. I did like the comedy of Kane and Daniel Bryan, and Punk&rsquo;s walk out. The Miz taking Jerry Lawler&rsquo;s place on commentary gave the evening a different flavor &ndash; a much-needed change up. Like almost every other three-hour Raw, though, this episode felt too long and, by the end, I was just waiting out the clock to a degree, despite Del Rio and Cena putting on a good match.</p>

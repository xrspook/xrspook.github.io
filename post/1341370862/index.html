<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-07-03 22:00:03</p>
<p>We are live from Corpus Christi, Texas and your announcers are Booker ‘I wrestled on a Great American Bash’ T, Josh ‘I have watched a Great American Bash’ Mathews, and Michael ‘A lot of Great Americans want to bash me’ Cole.</p>
<p>We see footage from last night when Alberto Del Rio attacked Sin Cara before their match.</p>
<p>Alberto looks at what we saw on the screen and he says that tonight he is not here to celebrate America. He is here to talk about something more important than that. He is going to talk about Alberto Del Rio. Finally, he got his one on one title match against Sheamus. He will send Sheamus crying back to Ireland like a little girl.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he knows why the people like Sheamus so much. It is because they are like him. They are hooligans and try to take advantage of hard working people like Alberto Del Rio. Alberto tells everyone to relax and stop hating him because he is successful. Alberto points out that he came to this country legally. He made a lot of money in Mexico and he is making a lot of money here.</p>
<p>After Money in the Bank, Sheamus is going back to the place where he belongs. Alberto says that he wants to send everyone back to the place where they belong. Alberto says that he wants to start right now.</p>
<p>Alberto asks a fan for his papers and then he tells the people in the front row that they don’t belong to be here. He calls the fans illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he is going to get rid of one of them before he gets rid of Sheamus. Alberto says that the fan is in the United States illegally. The fan says that this is not Arizona, this is Texas.</p>
<p>Sheamus’ music plays and he goes after Del Rio and they fight on the ramp. Sheamus punches Del Rio and throws him off the stage. Sheamus attacks Ricardo and then Sheamus sends Del Rio into the dasher board and barrier. Sheamus works over Ricardo and Del Rio with a kick and punches.</p>
<p>Ricardo opens the hood to the car and he tells Alberto to slam it on Sheamus. Alberto does what Ricardo suggests.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back with a Moments Ago Moment of Del Rio’s attempts to show Sheamus under the hood of his car.</p>
<p>We see Sheamus over by the car and he is bleeding from the forehead.</p>
<p>The announcers talk about whether Del Rio’s actions mean that he is going to win at Money in the Bank.</p>
<p>Match Number Six: Who Gets to be the Next Smackdown GM for a Week Battle Royal (Featuring: Justin Gabriel, Heath Slater, Jack Swagger, Zack Ryder, Cody Rhodes, Tensai, Brodus Clay, Dolph Ziggler, Damien Sandow, R Truth, CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, John Cena, Kane, Big Show, Alberto Del Rio, Ezekiel Jackson, Kofi Kingston, Great Khali, Christian)</p>

Punk with a cross body that eliminates himself and then Bryan. Kane with boots to Tensai and Chrsitian. Kane punches Del Rio and then Irish whips him and hits the side slam.

<p><strong>WWE SmackDown Results - The Great American Bash Battle Royal, Legends Return, More</strong></p>
<p>By Marc Middleton | July 03, 2012</p>
<p>- Josh Mathews, Michael Cole and Booker T welcome us to the show and hype the big 20-man battle royal for tonight. Cole says he will be interviewing AJ Lee tonight. He calls her the most controversial person in WWE. We go to the ring and Lilian Garcia introduces Ricardo Rodriguez, who begins the introduction of Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>We get a look back at Del Rio destroying Sin Cara on RAW. Del Rio says he isn&rsquo;t here to celebrate America - he&rsquo;s here to talk about something more important - him. Del Rio says he will defeat Sheamus and send him back to Ireland crying like a little girl. Del Rio says Sheamus is just like the fans - a common peasant, a hooligan. Del Rio continues ripping into the fans. He has Ricardo point out a fan at ringside. Del Rio tells the guy to show him his papers. Del Rio says the guy doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be here. He walks around ringside ripping the Spanish fans. He calls one kid a little alien. Del Rio finds an obvious plant and asks for security to remove him because he&rsquo;s here illegally. Del Rio goes after the man and Sheamus comes out. Del Rio shoves Ricardo into Sheamus but Sheamus pushes him aside and they go at it. Sheamus and Del Rio fight up the ramp. Sheamus stops and lays out Ricardo on the stage. Sheamus goes to the side of the ramp and works over Del Rio. Ricardo comes back over and this allows for Del Rio to drop Sheamus. They double team him for a minute. Ricardo opens the hood of the car. Del Rio leans Sheamus on the car and slams the hood over his back repeatedly. Del Rio talks trash as Sheamus is down on the floor. We go to commercial.</p>
<p>- Back from the break and we see a replay of what just happened to Sheamus. Officials help Sheamus to his feet and he&rsquo;s busted open.</p>
<p>- We see footage from earlier when Alberto Del Rio and Sheamus brawled. It&rsquo;s announced Sheamus can&rsquo;t compete in tonight&rsquo;s battle royal.</p>
<p>20-Man Great American Bash Battle Royal</p>
<p>Out first comes Alberto Del Rio for tonight&rsquo;s main event. The pyro goes off and Kane is out next. Jack Swagger is out next followed by John Cena before we take a commercial break.</p>
<p>Back from the break and several more Superstars are in the ring. Tensai comes out followed by WWE Champion CM Punk and Big Show. Show hits the ring and here we go. Everyone goes at it. Show chops Justin Gabriel and eliminates him. Show eliminates Brodus Clay next. The Great Khali works on Heath Slater while Santino goes at it with Ryder. Ezekiel Jackson gets eliminated. Sandow comes close to eliminating Cena but he fights back in. Tensai and several others eliminate Khali.</p>
<p>Sandow gets eliminated. Santino is out next. Kane and Tensai go at it now. Cody fights Big Show and gets grabbed by the throat. Show also grabs Kofi Kingston and eliminates them both at the same time. We go back to commercial.</p>
<p>Back from the break and it&rsquo;s down to 10 Superstars. Punk and Bryan go at it in the middle of the ring. Punk charges and eliminates himself as well as Bryan. Kane and Tensai go at it. Kane drops Tensai and then Christian. Kane attacks Del Rio next and hits a big sideslam. Kane grabs Show and chokeslams him after a struggle. Tensai brawls Kane into the corner and beats him down. Del Rio joins in and they double team him. Ziggler, Tensai and Del Rio go after Cena now and take turns hitting him. Cena fights them off and unloads, hitting the usual moves. Cena eliminates Del Rio. Cena hits the Attitude Adjustment on Kane but gets dropped by Tensai. Tensai tries to eliminate Cena but he holds on.</p>
<p>Cena fights back and eliminates Tensai. Show comes from behind and eliminates Cena. Ryder charges but Show spears him. Show catches Christian in mid-air and eliminates him. Ziggler jumps on Show&rsquo;s back and applies the sleeper. Kane comes over and big boots them both for a double elimination. It&rsquo;s down to Kane and Zack Ryder. Ryder charges but Kane knocks him to the mat. Kane stomps Ryder down in the corner and scoops him for a Tombstone. Ryder slides out but gets hit with a big boot. Ryder trips Kane in the corner and hits the Broski Boot. Ryder goes for the Ruff Ryder but Kane grabs him for a chokeslam. Ryder slides out and ducks as Kane charges, sending him over the top rope for the win. Zack Ryder will be the SmackDown General Manager next week.</p>
<p>Winner: Zack Ryder</p>
<p>- Ryder celebrates in the ring as SmackDown goes off the air.</p>

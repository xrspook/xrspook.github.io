<p><strong>Lucha Underground Results (5/6): Johnny Mundo Vs. Alberto El Patron, Prince Puma In Action, More</strong></p>
<p>By Sean Ross Sapp | May 06, 2015</p>
<p>Welcome to Wrestling Inc&rsquo;s coverage of Lucha Underground! Tonight we&rsquo;ll see a huge main event, with Johnny Mundo vs. Alberto El Patron.</p>
<p><strong>Alberto El Patron vs. Johnny Mundo</strong></p>
<p>El Patron is over huge. The two trade holds early on, but reach a stalemate. Patron is using some dirty tactics, but the crowd still loves him. Mundo clotheslines AEP off of a missed moonsault and sets up a springboard kick for two.</p>
<p>Mundo is knocked outside and AEP follows him with a huge suicide dive onto the stairs and guardrail and everything else in sight. The two trade punches in the ring until Patron hits a clothesline and tilt-a-whirl backbreaker.</p>
<p>Mundo sends AEP outside this time and hits a dive. He tosses Patron into every guardrail in the arena, but when he gets back in the ring, eats a top rope reverse superplex for two.</p>
<p>Patron calls for the armbar, but a huge series of reversals result in nearfalls. Mundo connects with his big knee and Starshi Pain, but Patron grabs the rope. AEP grabs an armbar out of nowhere, but Mundo gets to the ropes.</p>
<p>A Mundo double stomp gets a two count, and he can&rsquo;t believe it. Patron lands a giant superkick for the pin.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto El Patron via pinfall (superkick)</p>
<p>El Patron celebrates as we see Catrina trying to raise Mil Muertes from the dead to close the show.</p>

<p><strong>LUCHA UNDERGROUND REPORT</strong></p>
<p>By Nathan Favel on 2015-05-07 09:59:42</p>
<p>Original Air Date: 5/6/15</p>
<p>Welcome to the inaugural edition of what should become a weekly review of El Rey Network’s Lucha Underground. This little known favorite of the independent wrestling world has been the most consistent wrestling broadcast on television in what feels like an eternity. Edited to look and feel like a telenovela, or as we commonly call them, soap operas, Lucha Underground has managed to infuse the robust spirit of Mexico’s best dramatic programs with the fiercest lucha libre possible, creating one of wrestling’s most original experiences. Without further ado, let’s get right to the action, inside of The Temple!</p>
<p>Commentators:</p>
<p>Matt Striker – Play–By-Play</p>
<p>Vampiro - Color</p>
<p>Match #4: Main Event - Alberto El Patron (Alberto Del Rio/Dos Caras Jr.) – AAA Mega Champion vs. Johnny Mundo (John Morrison) - #2 Contender’s Match to the Lucha Underground World Heavyweight Championship</p>
<p>Now this is what wrestling is meant to be all about. These two men, who received next to nothing from Vince McMahon when they both worked in the WWE, were able to do more in the span of this one match than they were able to do in what the numerous years they worked for the man. From bell to bell, these awesome athletes created one of wrestling’s best matches this year and truly set the bar higher for all others who dare accept the challenge. I could go on gushing, but I think it’s safe to say that words can’t do such a performance justice. Please, do all that you can to watch this masterstroke of wrestling prowess.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto El Patron - #2 Contender to the Lucha Underground World Heavyweight Championship</p>
<p>News of the Night:</p>
<p>1: Dario Cueto, the general manager of Lucha Underground, threatened to bring in The Monster if The Crew didn’t take out the tag team champions tonight. I have no clue as to who such a beast would be, but I hope he/she can wrestle lucha, or else he/she will stick out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>2: Daivari, who has worked for WWE, TNA and Ring of Honor in recent years, has begun his latest gimmick, this time as a Beverly Hills millionaire who made his money after an excursion outside of wrestling. The gimmick worked for JBL, so why can’t Daivari play the part of a self-made millionaire?</p>
<p>3: Konnan sided with Prince Puma after Hernandez attacked Puma during their match with Cuerno and Cage. I think it wise to keep Puma with Konnan, if only to avoid any contrivance right now, as such an angle has already been done to death by every other company in wrestling.</p>
<p>4: Black Lotus, a female wrestler for Lucha Underground, left her master after his plead for her to remain under his tutelage.</p>
<p>5: Katrina, a Lucha Underground valet, resurrected Mil Muertes his grave and seemingly as a rudo, or heel. Muertes is meant to be positioned in LU in the same way that The Undertaker is in the WWE, being that of a mystical nature.</p>
<p>6: Alberto El Patron will soon wrestle Hernandez for the #1 Contender’s spot to the Lucha Underground World Heavyweight Championship.</p>
<p>Final Analysis: This was a solid edition of Lucha Underground that was highlighted by a magnificent main event. If LU can continue to present matches like the main event on a regular basis, then they will have their chance to become more than just a cult favorite in the wrestling world.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this debut review of Lucha Underground and I hope to see you, next time.</p>

<p><strong>The Over/Under On Lucha Underground Episode 26: Rise From Your Grave</strong></p>
<p>By Brandon Stroud • 05.08.15</p>
<p>And now, the Over/Under on Lucha Underground episode 26 from May 6, 2015.</p>
<p>Over: How Dario Cueto Books A Show</p>
<p>This week’s opening doesn’t have a hook like bad Lucha Libre Kung Fu, a spaceman looking to the stars for inspiration or the threat of someone being fed to a cage monster, but it might be my favorite opening yet. Why? Because we find out how Dario Cueto books matches in The Temple.</p>
<p>Johnny Mundo and Alberto El Patrón are still arguing about who’s better, and they’ve decided to stop inappropriately touching each other in the men’s room and take it to the boss’s office. Cueto ultimately puts them in a match against one another with the winner moving on to face Hernandez (hilariously called “Fernandez” by Mundo) to name a true, official #1 contender to the Lucha Underground Championship. That’s all well and good, but the money is that Cueto books cards using those magnets of random words people sometimes have on their refrigerator.</p>
<p>Seriously, he’s got a little slip of paper that says JOHNNY MUNDO and a little slip of paper that says ALBERTO EL PATRON. That’s so amazing. I want to see the little Scrabble tile bag he keeps them all in, and go through it to see if like, Chris Masters is on the Lucha Underground roster but never gets his name chosen. Dario Cueto is an evil Spanish business mastermind who organizes his machinations with ARTS AND CRAFTS. “Tonight Chonny, you will be facing A PIPE CLEANER.”</p>
<p><strong>Over: That’s The Kick That Won Him A Shot At Hernandez For A Shot At The Lucha Underground Championship Maggle</strong></p>
<p>This week’s main-event is Mundo vs. Alberto, and it might be the best match I’ve ever seen from either of them. It’s certainly Johnny’s best, and the Lucha Underground environment has legitimately turned him into the pro wrestler people wanted him to be in WWE.</p>
<p>It manages to be a typical and atypical Lucha Underground match at the same time. They hit the storytelling beats a main-event WWE match would — finisher kickouts, a big series of reversals at the end, big dramatic selling on the ground — but there’s a freedom of movement and move choice that Lucha provides. They don’t have their four signature moves and try to hit them, they feel like they’re wrestling. Like they’re competing in this world of heightened physical realism where you can springboard off some free-standing cables and kick somebody in the head and it’s a good idea.</p>
<p>The finishing sequence is great, with Alberto going for his Harry Potter Kick, Mundo dodging it and springing off the ropes with a kick, Alberto dodging THAT and connecting with the kick (with authority) for the dramatic win. Alberto also fell a little too far back and rested on his shoulders, with his Wrestling Body Language for “this is going to be disputed.” It’s just great, great stuff, and you should seek it out. It’s powerful to watch guys you always thought of as being “held back” perform on a show where holding back doesn’t exist.</p>

<p><strong>COMPLETE WWE RAW REPORT: THE WWE TITLE MATCH IS OFFICIAL NOW; A MOVE YOU NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE IN THE MAIN EVENT; CAN A TEAM BEAT OPPONENTS WHO ARE BLINDFOLDED AND HAVE AN ARM TIED BEHIND THEIR BACK?; MIZTV GOES CROSSFIRE; THERE WILL BE BLOOD; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-02-25 23:09:51</p>
<p>Previously, in the WWE . . . John Cena and CM Punk agreed to wrestle tonight to determine who would be the man to face the Rock at Wrestlemania for the WWE Title and the brand new championship belt. Paul Heyman was informed that Brad Maddox was the assistant to the role that Vickie Guerrero has on Raw, but that was not the worst news for the man who stands by CM Punk’s side. Paul would also be told that he will be facing Vince McMahon in a fight on this week’s show. We are not less than six weeks from Wrestlemania and it seems like it would be the time for a few of the matches to develop.</p>
<p>We are in Dallas, Texas and your announcers are Michael ‘Did you know that I am from Texas’ Cole and Jerry ‘Did you know that I beat up most of the Von Erichs’ Lawler.</p>
<p>It is time to take a look at the Marine 3: Homefront starring The Miz, coming to DVD and Blu-Ray.</p>
<p>Miz makes his way to the ring for MizTV.</p>
<p>The guests for MizTV are in the ring. On one side of the ring, Zeb Colter and Jack Swagger. On the other side is Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Miz says that he would start things off with a lot of hype but he wants to cut to the chase. He introduces his guests.</p>
<p>Miz asks Zeb and Jack about the controversy they had last week. Miz says that he is giving them the opportunity to say things to Alberto’s face.</p>
<p>Zeb says that he was looking forward to the opportunity to talk to Glenn Beck, but since he chickened out, he is looking forward to talking to Alberto. He introduces himself and Jack as Real Americans. He says that there is a problem in this country. There are 11 million undocumented workers in this country. He calls them undocumented because of the politically correct.</p>
<p>They want to grant them amnesty to allow them to be citizens. Real Americans have a tough enough time getting jobs. They sneak across the border and take our jobs, our medical resources and they stomp on our productivity. Zeb says that Alberto’s people drain our resources.</p>
<p>Alberto interrupts and then Miz stops him to hear from Alberto.</p>
<p>Miz asks Alberto about obtaining citizenship in Mexico but Zeb starts to answer Miz.</p>
<p>Alberto says to let Zeb talk.</p>
<p>Zeb says that he doesn’t know anyone who wants to be a citizen of Mexico. He says that it takes ten years to become a citizen. Zeb says that a foreigner cannot own property in Mexico. He wants to know what is wrong with Alberto and his people.</p>
<p>Zeb tells Alberto and Sling Blade to calm down. He says that this is not personal. It is what Alberto represents. Alberto represents success and the American dream. He encourages millions of illegals to cross the border to achieve their dreams. There is only one Alberto Del Rio success story. The ones who fail forget to leave this country. He says that they are not going to stand by and let this happen. He says that we call them criminals.</p>
<p>Alberto and Zeb yell at each other and then Alberto tells Zeb that it is time to shut up.</p>
<p>Alberto says that America does not belong to Zeb or to him, it belongs to everyone. He is no different than the people in the crowd or Zeb. He says that they descend from immigrants. They both want to provide their families with a better life. They are here with the promise that if you work hard in America, everything is possible.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he is living proof of that. Do they think they can come out here and bully everyone while hiding behind the Constitution. Alberto says that he did not know anything about Zeb two weeks ago. He heard about people like him but he never met one like him. Alberto says that he does not like bullies and if Zeb has the cajones, why not do something to make them leave right now.</p>
<p>Jack takes the mic and he says that WE will see you at Wrestlemania. WE the people. Jack throws down the mic and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Six: Jack Swagger (with Zeb Colter) versus Miz</strong></p>
<p>Miz with punches to Swagger but Swagger pushes him away. Miz with more punches and then he back body drops Swagger over the top rope to the floor. Miz with a drop kick to keep Swagger on the floor. Miz comes off the apron and Swagger catches Miz and he hits a belly-to-belly suplex on the floor.</p>
<p>Del Rio and Ricardo watch from the back.</p>
<p>Swagger sends Miz into the ropes and he connects with a forearm to the kidneys. Swagger with another forearm to the kidneys. He goes for a third one but Miz with punches of his won. Swagger with an Irish whip and knees to the midsection. Swagger with a running knee into the corner.</p>
<p>Swagger traps the arms but Miz gets to his feet. Swagger with a forearm but Miz with a knee to the knee and a knee lift. Swagger with a clothesline. Swagger with boots to Miz’ midsection. Swagger with a slam and then he hits the double jump Swagger Bomb for a near fall. Swagger with an arm bar.</p>
<p>Miz hits the Reality Check and both men are down. Swagger with a power slam for a near fall. Miz struggles to get to his feet and Swagger punches him in the corner. Miz with punches to Swagger. Swagger with a kick to the midsection but Miz with a clothesline and punches. Miz with a boot to the chest and then it is time for the Awesome Clothesline and then Miz goes up top for the double sledge and he connects.</p>
<p>Miz gets a near fall. Miz tries for a running boot but Swagger blocks it. Miz counters with a sunset flip for a near fall. Swagger sends Miz into the ropes when Miz tries for a DDT. Miz gets his ankle caught in the ropes and Swagger kicks Miz while hanging in the ropes.</p>
<p>Swagger clips the leg and Swagger waits to pounce and he applies the ankle lock and Miz taps out.</p>
<p>Winner: Jack Swagger</p>

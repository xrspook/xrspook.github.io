<blockquote>
<p>We go back to the animated CM Punk’s attempts to light the Christmas tree and he continues to fail. He is knocked out of the way and an animated John Cena comes to save the day and he lights the tree and we see Santa in the background.</p>
<p>Raw is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and your announcers are Jerry ‘Will anyone mind if I wear a Browns jersey’ Lawler and Michael ‘The Fish that Saved Pittsburgh’ Cole.</p>
<p>Our host makes his way to the ring and it is Santa Claus. Santa has some gifts for the fans along the aisle. While Santa gives out more gifts, Ricardo Rodriguez comes out to introduce Alberto Del Rio, who drives into the arena and he hits Santa.</p>
<p>Ricardo and Alberto don’t know what to do while the medical staff checks on Santa. Santa gives the thumbs up and the people cheer.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back at the crime scene in the arena and we see why the police tape is out. We see Del Rio hitting Santa Claus as Cole speaks in a very somber tone. We will get updates later in the night.</p>
<p>Everyone is standing outside the trainer’s room waiting for an update on Santa. Booker emerges and he says that he will not sugar coat it. Santa is down and he don’t look good. Everyone needs to pull together and the show must go on.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio stops by and John Cena yells at Del Rio for running over Santa. Alberto says that he did not know that Santa would be there. He says that it is not his fault.</p>
<p>Booker tells Alberto that before Santa lost consciousness, his last words were that Alberto will be in a fight. A Miracle on 34th Street Fight . . . against John Cena.</p>
<p>Booker tells John to do it for Santa.</p>
<p>We are back and David Otunga is in the ring. He says that he is the only Harvard educated lawyer in the history of the WWE. That makes him uniquely qualified to discuss the situation involving Santa and Alberto Del Rio. People are quick to pass judgment and assign blame. He says that people are pre judging and they are prejudiced. David says that Alberto is really the victim. Santa is guilty of trespassing and working without the proper visas.</p>
<p>Zack Ryder says that Alberto ran over Santa. The man who says ho ho ho is in the back getting treatment while Otunga faces the man who says woo woo woo.</p>
<p>Michael Cole reminds us that Santa suffered some injuries as a result of colliding with Alberto Del Rio’s hood.</p>
<p>In case you missed it the first four or five times, we see the horrible automobile accident involving Santa Claus and Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>We go to Matt Striker for the latest update on Santa. Matt says that Santa has taken a turn for the worst and he is about to be taken to a medical facility but it looks like he is doing much better. It is a Christmas Eve Miracle.</p>
<p>Ricardo comes out and he cannot do the usual Alberto introduction because of what happened earlier to Santa.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Nine: John Cena versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) in a Miracle on 34th . . . Street Fight</strong></p>
<p>Cena yells at Del Rio for running over Santa. Del Rio pushes Cena and says that it was an accident. Cena punches Del Rio and then he climbs the turnbuckles. Cena sends Del Rio to the floor and Del Rio Irish whips Cena into the ring steps and Del Rio kicks Cena in the shoulder as a prelude for the cross arm breaker.</p>
<p>Del Rio gets a near fall and then he stomps on the arm. Del Rio tells Ricardo to get the mic. Del Rio says that it was an accident and then he hits Cena with the mic. He was not trying to hurt Santa. He hits Cena with the mic one more time. Cena blocks another shot with the mic and Cena kicks Del Rio and hits Alberto in the head with the mic. Cena grabs a present and he opens it. Cena pulls out a steel chair.</p>
<p>Cena hits Del Rio in the midsection and back with the chair. Cena gets a near fall. Cena chases Ricardo around the ring and Del Rio with a clotheslines when the get into the ring. Del Rio with kicks and punches to Cena. Ricardo gives Alberto a present and Del Rio opens it.</p>
<p>It is a pie and Del Rio tries to throw it in Cena’s face but he hits Ricardo instead. Cena with a kick followed by an Irish whip and bulldog. Cena sends Del Rio to the floor and Cena sends Del Rio into the barrier on the ramp. The fight onto the stage and Cena gets another present.</p>
<p>Cena picks up a monitor and he hits Del Rio in the head with it. We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Del Rio is in control. We see Ricardo distracting Cena and Del Rio with a superkick to the shoulder. Alberto is given another present and Ricardo says that it is a bazooka, but it is a teddy bear. Del Rio throws the teddy bear at Cena and Cena is fine. Alberto grabs Ricardo and then Cena sends Del Rio into the presents. Cena puts a wreath over Ricardo and then gives him a present to the head.</p>
<p>They fight down the ramp and back to the ring. Cena sends Del Rio into the apron and then into the barrier. Cena goes back for another present and the crowd wants him to use the tree. Cena picks up the tree and takes it to the ringside area and he hits Del Rio with the tree.</p>
<p>Cena opens another present and he has a bowling ball. Cena lines up for the 7-10 split on Del Rio and he hits Del Rio in the head pin. Cena goes for another present and it is a fire extinguisher. Cena stands over Del Rio and he goes into the ring and sprays Alberto with the extinguisher.</p>
<p>Ricardo jumps on Cena’s back and applies a sleeper.</p>
<p>Santa’s music plays and he makes his way to the ring with his bag of presents. Ricardo is jubilant that Santa is okay. Santa hits Ricardo with the bag of presents and he gives Del Rio Mr. Socko. Cena with Attitude Adjustment for the three count.</p>
<p>Winner: John Cena</p>
<p>After the match, Cena and Santa celebrate in the ring.</p>

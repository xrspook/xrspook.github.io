<p><strong>WWE RAW REPORT: HAS THE CEREBRAL ASSASSIN BEEN OUTSMARTED?; ORTON UPS THE ANTE; STIPULATION FOR PUNK VS. RYBACK; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-10-14 20:05:30</p>
<p>We are in St. Louis, Missouri and your announcers are Michael ‘What will happen to Randy Orton in his home town’ Cole, John ‘I want to see El Torito leap from the Gateway Arch’ Layfield, and Jerry ‘What gets thrown in the Mississippi River tonight’ Lawler.</p>
<p>We are back and it is time for Triple H to make his way to the ring. He is accompanied by one of the principal owners of WWE, Stephanie McMahon.</p>
<p>Stephanie says that last week on Raw, she learned a very valuable lesson. She is not going to let her kindness be seen as weakened.</p>
<p>Stephanie says that they have bailed out the Big Show more times than they can remember. They bought his mortgage and they were treated with disrespect and insubordination. After being fired, Big Show came to the ring and struck her husband in the face.</p>
<p>Stephanie says that Big Show is unemployed and fired. They are selling his house and repossessing anything that has value. They are suing him for trespassing and assault. Insolence will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Stephanie says that there were reports of a concussion and a jaw that had to be wired shut. Stephanie reminds us that he is Triple H, the 13 time champion, the Cerebral Assassin, and the King of Kings. He wielded power in the Attitude Era and he is the WWE.</p>
<p>Hunter says rumors of his demise have been greatly exaggerated. He has been the COO of the WWE for two years. Hunter says that he did that all for you. He put aside his personal and professional needs to ensure that this company would be here for everyone. He became the authority, knowing what it would entail because people do not like the boss.</p>
<p>He dealt with the walkouts and insubordination. Hunter says that his breaking point took place last week when he was unconscious in the ring while people were chanting ‘Yes’. The crowd chants ‘Yes’.</p>
<p>Hunter says this is the way it is. After all they have done, they are just the villains. Hunter asks if everyone wants him to be the bad guy . . . fine. He will give you something like you have never seen before. Big Show will grovel at his feet to avoid incarceration or financial ruin. Anyone who defies their authority will beg to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>Anyone who thought the word yes better pray right now.</p>
<p>Daniel Bryan’s music plays and he makes his way to the stage and he gets everyone to start chanting yes, if they weren’t already chanting it.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio attacks Daniel Bryan from behind and they make their way down the ramp. Del Rio sets for the super kick and he connects.</p>
<p>Stephanie asks Daniel if he was saying something. Stephanie introduces Daniel to his opponent tonight, Alberto Del Rio.</p>

<p><strong>WWE RAW REPORT: TOO McMANY McMAHONS?; WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE NO LONG A HEYMAN &lsquo;CLIENT&rsquo;; MARK HENRY GIVES AN EMOTIONAL SPEECH; A SCARE FOR DANIEL BRYAN; IS STEPHANIE MCMAHON THE NEW KAREN JARRETT?; WHAT IF PEOPLE DON&rsquo;T COME OUT DURING PROMO SEGMENTS, HOW WOULD WE GET MATCHES?; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-06-17 20:11:01</p>
<p>Last night, the man whose father was associated with perfection was able to win his first title in the WWE. Meanwhile, the man whose entrance music mentions ‘Perfection’ was unable to retain the World Title, possibly due to the concussion he recently suffered. The Shield still has their titles and John Cena was able to vanquish Ryback by sending him through the roof of an ambulance during Three Stages of Hell. Will we encounter the Fourth Stage of Hell if the rumors circulating about Mark Henry are true? What will Mark tell everyone tonight?</p>
<p>We are in Grand Rapids, Michigan and your announcers are Jerry ‘Isn’t there someone from Michigan returning to WWE soon’ Lawler, Michael ‘With the siren on the ambulance, I thought someone from Michigan was returning’ Cole, and John ‘We make references to Michigan on Monday nights’ Layfield.</p>
<p>Ricardo Rodriguez is on the stage to introduce the new World Champion and he is doing it in Spanish. The reaction to Del Rio is mixed after what he did last night.</p>
<p>Alberto takes the mic and he asks everyone how their weekend was. He says that he heard people talking about man of steel, but why do it when you have a man of gold.</p>
<p>Some people say the way he won was controversial, but what about the night after Wrestlemania when Dolph Ziggler attacked him when he was injured with his leg practically broken. He was in terrible pain but he gave Ziggler a fight. On that night, the people cheered for Ziggler.</p>
<p>They cheered for a coward who attacked an injured man. Alberto says that he should be surprised or offended but he is not. He says that he gets it. He hears the reactions each night. He gave the people everything. Then he fought an ignorant pig like Jack Swagger who offended the Mexican people. All heard was ‘USA” They don’t cheer for him but they cheer for a pig and a coward. That is what America is all about . . . pigs and cowards.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he fought for everyone for the last five months and he got nothing. Last night, he fought for Alberto Del Rio and he won the title. Alberto says that he is going to be the better man in this situation and he will show us why he is the best. He will give everyone a second chance to show him the respect he deserves.</p>
<p>CM Punk’s music interrupts and he makes his way to the ring with Paul Heyman.</p>
<p>Punk says that it feels like it has been a while. The last time they were in the ring together, he beat Alberto at Survivor Series when he beat Alberto to hold the title for 434 days. Punk says that it looks like Alberto remembers. He is not out here because of the problems he has with the people. He is out here because Alberto says that he was the best.</p>
<p>There is only one “Best in the World” and Alberto is looking at him. Punk says that he is challenging Alberto.</p>
<p>Paul says that his client don’t fight for free and Punk asks Paul what he is doing.</p>
<p>Paul says that they didn’t talk about it earlier.</p>
<p>Punk says that he knows that Dolph is owed a rematch. While Alberto was stealing the title from Dolph, he was stealing the show with Chris Jericho. Last night, Punk proved that he was the best in the world. He wants to do it tonight and against Del Rio.</p>
<p>Alberto tells Punk that he doesn’t want to do this. Punk says that he does want to do this. He wants a match tonight.</p>
<p>Alberto reminds Punk that he is the World Champion and he reminds Punk that he said that he doesn’t want him.</p>
<p>Punk asks Ricardo if he has his tights on.</p>
<p>Vickie Guerrero and Brad Maddox come out to excuse themselves. She tells Alberto that unfortunately, he does not make this decision, she does. She says that she cannot think of a better way to add to the momentum from Payback than to have a main event of Alberto Del Rio versus CM Punk.</p>
<p>Wade Barrett sulks and walks in the back. We go to commercial.</p>
<p>Paul and Punk are in the back and Paul apologizes for jumping the gun. Punk reminds Paul of what he told him last night. Paul almost cost him the match last night. He does not need Paul’s help to win matches. He is not Brock Lesnar or Curtis Axel. He is not Paul’s client. He does not want Paul in his corner any more. He will always be a Paul Heyman guy.</p>
<p>We are back with a look at how we got CM Punk versus Alberto Del Rio (without the obvious fact that Vickie Guerrero pulled a Teddy and saw an even number of people in the ring so she made a match)</p>
<p>CM Punk is walking in the back and Paul Heyman stops him and he tells Punk that everyone is trying to stir this up but he will not let it happen. He thanks Punk for letting him be a part of this. Paul says that he loves Punk and he hugs him.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Seven: Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) versus CM Punk</strong></p>
<p>Punk with punches and knees to Del Rio and Alberto regroups on the floor with Ricardo. Del Rio returns to the ring and Punk with kicks to the legs and Del Rio goes to the floor to avoid the kicks. Punk goes after Del Rio on the floor and he chops Del Rio and sends him back into the ring. Del Rio with a kick to the head when Punk re-enters.</p>
<p>Del Rio with another kick to the head. Del Rio with a suplex and he gets a near fall. Punk with punches to Del Rio and more kicks. Punk with knees to Del Rio but Del Rio with a kick and punches in the corner. Del Rio with a step up round kick to the ribs and arm. Del Rio wraps the other arm in the ropes.</p>
<p>Punk with a kick and forearms and then he gets Del Rio on his shoulders but Punk does not use his left arm and Del Rio is able to escapes. Punk with a suicide dive onto Del Rio but Punk still holds his left arm.</p>
<p>Punk sends Del Rio’s arm into the ringside barrier. Punk sends Del Rio back into the ring and Ricardo’s distraction allows Del Rio to drop the left arm on the ropes and Del Rio with a kick to the left arm and Punk falls to the floor as we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Del Rio with an arm bar but Punk with an arm drag to escape. Del Rio charges into a boot from Punk but Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker for a near fall. Del Rio with head butts to Punk followed by a round kick to the head. Del Rio with a boot to the head and he gets a near fall. Del Rio goes to the apron and turnbuckles but Punk with a punch to the midsection as he comes off. Punk with a back heel kick and leg lariat.</p>
<p>Punk with knees but he misses a round kick and Del Rio with a single arm DDT to the injured arm. Del Rio puts Punk in the ropes and he goes for the diez forearms to the back and then he hits the lungblower and Del Rio with a near fall.</p>
<p>Punk avoids a super kick and he gets a near fall with a roll up. Del Rio hits yet another super kick and he gets a near fall. Del Rio gestures for the cross arm breaker and he tries to float over but Punk sends Del Rio into the turnbuckles and then he connects with a knee and then Punk with the Go To Sleep but Del Rio falls to the floor.</p>
<p>Del Rio has had enough and he allows the referee to get to ten.</p>
<p>Winner: CM Punk (by count out)</p>
<p>After the match, Del Rio is attacked from behind by Dolph Ziggler and officials try to stop him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Punk shakes it all off and he is declared the winner.</p>
<p>Brock Lesnar’s music plays and he makes his way onto the stage and then to the ring.</p>
<p>Brock and Punk circle each other in the ring. Brock takes the mic and he looks at Punk. Lesnar picks up Punk and hits the F-5.</p>

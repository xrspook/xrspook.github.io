<p><strong>COMPLETE WWE RAW REPORT: THE BIGGEST NAME IN WWWF GOING INTO THE HALL OF FAME; HAS THE SHIELD MET ITS MATCH?; WHO WANTS A REMATCH? HOW ABOUT THREE; A FORMER WORLD CHAMPION RETURNS; ROOM SERVICE GOES TOO FAR; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-02-04 20:21:41</p>
<p>Last week, we almost saw Paul Heyman get fired because a man who looked a lot like Paul Heyman, but who was not Paul Heyman was seen consorting with The Shield. Before Vince McMahon could utter the words that made him famous, but was usurped by Donald Trump, Brock Lesnar returned and he gave Vince an F-5. We also found out which title John Cena would put in the main event at Wrestlemania. What will happen as we move closer to the Elimination Chamber?</p>
<p>We are in Atlanta, Georgia and your announcers are Michael ‘I miss the Omni’ Cole and Jerry ‘Breaking the Hearts of Sports Fans except for 1995’ Lawler.</p>
<p>We take a look at what has happened between Big Show, Alberto Del Rio, and Ricardo Rodriguez last week on WWE Television.</p>
<p>Match Number Three: Alberto Del Rio versus Cody Rhodes</p>
<p>Cody with a kick and forearms. Rhodes with an Irish whip but he runs into an elbow and Del Rio with a rana and then he sends Rhodes into the air and then to the mat. Del Rio with a kick. Cody with a slap and Del Rio with kicks to Rhodes.</p>
<p>Del Rio with the running step up enzuigiri to the shoulder for a near fall. Rhodes with a kick to the leg and then Cody with an atomic drop to the leg. Rhodes with boots to Del Rio and punches. Rhodes with a head butt and then he charges into the corner but misses.</p>
<p>Del Rio with two clotheslines and then he avoids one and instead of a power slam, Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker. Del Rio with a super kick for a near fall. Rhodes with Beautiful Disaster but he can only get a two count. Del Rio floats over into the cross arm breaker and Cody taps out.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>After the match, Alberto Del Rio says that he is a different person. He used to look down on everyone, but now he knows that he was wrong. Big Show tried to bully him, just like everyone. He was not going to let that happen. That is why he appreciates the support of the fans. They make him open his eyes and now he is the World Champion, not just for him. He is doing this for the people who struggle and fight.</p>
<p>Alberto tells Big Show that he is going to pay what he did to his best friend Ricardo. If Show thinks that what happened last Friday was bad . . .</p>
<p>Big Show interrupts on the TitanTron and he tells Alberto to calm down. Show says that he is in a secured location off sight.</p>
<p>Del Rio calls Show a coward and says that Show has no cajones.</p>
<p>Show tells Del Rio to speak in English. Show says that it is hard for him to control the rage that he has. It would be so easy to snap Del Rio in half. He is not afraid because Del Rio had a stick with him in the parking lot. Show says that he left to keep himself from ripping Del Rio apart.</p>
<p>This is about Del Rio stealing the title from him. Show says that he wants a rematch against Del Rio at the Elimination Chamber.</p>
<p>Show tells Del Rio that Booker knows where he is and if Del Rio signs the contract, he will have Booker bring the contract to him. Show tells Del Rio not to look for him in the hotel. If Del Rio thinks that what he did to Ricardo was bad, wait to see what happens if Del Rio looks for him.</p>
<p>We are back and Big Show is finishing his dinner and he is on the phone with Booker wanting to know if the contract is on the way. There is a knock at the door. Show thinks it is the person with the contract.</p>
<p>The person has the contract and he wants to tell Show something. Show signs the contract and he says that he knows that this guy is his biggest fans. Show says that he does not do birthday tweets or photos. Show opens the door and Alberto Del Rio is waiting outside.</p>
<p>They fight in the hallway and Del Rio gets in a few shots but Show with punches and kicks. Show throws Del Rio onto a table in the hallway. Show kicks Alberto as they fight by the elevator. Show takes the leg of a table and he is going to use it but Del Rio sprays the contents of a fire extinguisher in Show’s face.</p>
<p>The elevator opens and Del Rio tries to make up a story and he gets on the elevator.</p>

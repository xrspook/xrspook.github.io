GUESS WHICH ONE WAS THE LAST MAN STANDING?</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-06-20 23:06:22</p>
<p>We are live from Baltimore, Maryland and your announcers are Michael ‘Why do people want to keep giving me crabs’ Cole, Jerry ‘King of Old Bay Seasoning’ Lawler, and Booker ‘Air Raid Alert System’ T</p>
<p>CM Punk makes his way into the arena and he has something to say to the people, who are going to be so important on tonight’s show.</p>
<p>Punk sits down in the center of the ring and he says ‘power to the people’ and he says that he would not trust any of them with the content of this television program. What terrible decisions could they make because they live in Baltimore. Punk says that no one can do anything tonight that will guide Punk’s career. He says that he is the best wrestler in the world. He says that he soundly defeated Rey Mysterio at Capitol Punishment. He soundly defeated John Cena last Monday night on Raw. Punk says that wins and losses do matter. Punk says that he is now the Number One Contender for the WWE Championship. He says that this is not a debate or an argument. It is a fact based on his accomplishments over the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Punk wants the anonymous Raw General Manager to send Michael Cole an e-mail to make him officially the Number One Contender to face John Cena at Money in the Bank in his home town of Chicago.</p>
<p>Punk tells the Gender unidentified General Manager that he is not going to leave the ring until he is declared the Number One Contender.</p>
<p>The Ding Dong sounds and so does the computer. Punk mirrors Cole’s announcement and he wants the announcement that he is the number one contender made. Cole quotes that he understands Punk’s demands and he will take them under consideration. He asks Punk to leave the ring.</p>

<p>The computer tells Cole to tell Punk that he leave the ring now.</p>
<p>Punk says that he is not going to leave the ring until he is made number one contender, but he is going to do snow angels.</p>
<p>The general manager says that he was going to name Punk the number one contender later, but now Punk will have to face Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>Punk says that Del Rio has a fluke victory over the Big Show.</p>
<p>The match is now a Triple Threat Match. CM Punk will now face Alberto Del Rio and Rey Mysterio. This causes the first of what will be many Booker T warning alarms tonight.</p>

<p>Alberto Del Rio drives into the arena and he tells us who he is . . . but we already knew that. He says that he is teaching people about destiny. What happened between Big Show, Ricardo Rodriguez, and his car was an accident. Del Rio says that was not an accident. It was destiny. He also told Big Show that bad things happen to bad people. Alberto says that his victory last night over Big Show was not an accident, it was destiny. He says that he will destroy CM Punk and Rey Mysterio. It will not be by accident, it will be pure destiny.</p>

<p>Winner: CM Punk</p>
<p>After the match, CM Punk gets the mic and he takes a seat in the ring. He says July 17, 2011 will be the most historic day, not only in the career of CM Punk, but for the WWE as a whole. Not only is July 17th the second annual Money in the Bank pay per view. It is the night that he defeats John Cena for the WWE Championship.</p>
<p>Now it is time for Punk to be brutally honest. Punk says that July 17th is the day that his contract with WWE comes to an end. Punk says that means that when the clock strikes midnight and the 17th becomes the 18th. When Sunday bleeds into Monday, he is leaving. Punk says that he is leaving with the WWE Title.</p>

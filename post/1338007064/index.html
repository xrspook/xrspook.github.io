<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: NUMBER ONE CONTENDER FOR WORLD TITLE; DAMIEN SANDOW WRESTLES; RYBACK GETS FED TWO MEN; WOULD SHEAMUS APOLOGIZE?</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-05-25 22:00:14</p>
<p>We begin with John Cena’s outburst on Raw after losing to John Laurinaitis at Over the Limit. Then we hear Big Show’s rebuttal and the announcement that John Cena will be facing Big Show (probably in the main event) at No Way Out.</p>
<p>We are live from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and your announcers are Michael ‘People Power’ Cole, Booker ‘Where is Michael Rooker’ T, and Josh ‘What about that Kidd/Cesaro match from Smackdown’ Mathews.</p>
<p>Michael Cole wonders if Sheamus will apologize to John Laurinaitis for almost knocking John over on Raw.</p>
<p>Lillian Garcia introduces Eve and in a bit of a shocker, it is Eve who makes her way to the ring.</p>
<p>Eve looks around and she remembers that she has something to say. She points out that John Laurinaitis is still the general manager of Raw and Smackdown after pinning John Cena on Sunday night. Due to an international WWE business trip, John is not here tonight.</p>
<p>She says that John has left her in charge. Her boss will deal with John Cena on Monday night, but tonight she is going to deal with Sheamus. Two things will happen tonight. Sheamus will issue a public apology for bumping into an injured John Laurinaitis on Monday night. Eve says that she will name Sheamus’ opponent for No Way Out.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio’s music interrupts Eve and he makes his way into the building in the non-traditional way, on foot. Alberto sucks up to Eve to try to convince her to give him the title match. He says that she is not only beautiful, but she is smart. She says that there is no one better than Alberto Del Rio to face Sheamus. He says that Eve knows this. Alberto makes it to the ring and he says that after what happened to him and his quest for the World Title has been horrible.</p>
<p>He says that Eve is perfect and she needs to think if she wants to make John Laurinaitis proud. She can do that by making Alberto the number one contender.</p>
<p>Eve says that Alberto makes a compelling case and there is no one more deserving . . .</p>
<p>Randy Orton appears to have issue with what Eve might say about Alberto Del Rio so he makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Orton tells Eve that she is new to the job so he wants to introduce himself to her. He says that she has a big decision to make on her hands so he suggests that the people help her out. Orton asks the wonderful people if they want to see Alberto Del Rio (lots of boos) or would they like to see him (lots of cheering). In the name of People Power, Randy thinks we have an answer.</p>
<p>Apparently Kane is not an advocate of People Power because he makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Kane says that neither of these men have the qualifications that he does. That pasty white Irish ghost should have to face the Devil’s Favorite Demon. In case she needs any more convincing, this week’s Smackdown is episode 666.</p>
<p>Eve says that there is only one way to settle this. The person who will face Sheamus is going to be the winner of tonight’s Triple Threat Match.</p>
<p>Santino Marella and Ricardo Rodriguez walk in split screen as we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back with footage from Monday night when Santino gave Ricardo the cobra.</p>
<p>Ricardo introduces himself as he makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Match Number Four: Santino Marella versus Ricardo Rodriguez</p>
<p>Santino with a side head lock and shoulder tackle. They criss cross until Santino stops to watch Ricardo run the ropes until he cannot run any more. Santino checks on Ricardo’s pulse before applying an airplane spin. Ricardo falls to the mat and so does Santino as he goes to the floor.</p>
<p>Santino hides under the ring and Ricardo thinks he is going to come out the other side but Santino comes out the same side he entered and Santino puts on his hand puppet. Santino tries to get Ricardo’s attention but it fails. Ricardo turns around into the Cobra and Santino gets the three count.</p>
<p>Winner: Santino Marella</p>
<p>Show leaves the ring and Kane’s pyro plays since it is time for the main event.</p>
<p>Kane makes his way to the ring but from out of nowhere, Daniel Bryan enters the ring with a chair and he attacks Kane with repeated shots to the body. Bryan is finally restrained by officials as Bryan yeses his way to the back.</p>
<p>Match Number Seven: Kane versus Randy Orton versus Alberto Del Rio in a Number One Contender Match</p>
<p>Before the match starts, Kane tries to shake off the attack by Bryan.</p>
<p>Orton with a kick and punches to Del Rio followed by punches to Kane. Del Rio kicks Orton and Orton sends Del Rio to the floor. Kane with a boot to Orton but Kane still feels the damage from the chair attack. Kane with a drop kick to Orton for a near fall. Kane with an Irish whip and splash into the corner. He tries again and Orton with a boot and then he this a back breaker but Del Rio breaks up the cover.</p>
<p>Del Rio punches Orton and then Kane with an uppercut to Del Rio. Orton clotheslines Del Rio over the top rope to the floor and then Kane clotheslines Orton over the top rope to the floor. Kane goes after Orton and then Del Rio. Orton sends Kane and Del Rio head first into the ringside barrier. Orton sends Kane’s head into the announce table.</p>
<p>Orton rolls back into the ring and he sets for the IEDDT on Kane but Del Rio with an enzuigiri and all three men are down as we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Kane with kicks ot Del Rio. Kane with an uppercut to Orton and he gets a near fall on Orton. Kane with a slam and then he hits an elbow drop for another near fall on Orton. Kane punches Del Rio but Del Rio wit a kick to the back and he sends Kane into the turnbuckles. Del Rio with a step up enzuigiri on Kane. Del Rio with kicks to Orton in the corner.</p>
<p>Orton sends Del Rio to the apron and Orton with a drop kick. Kane with an Irish whip and side slam for a near fall. Kane goes up top for the flying clothesline but Del Rio with a step up enzuigiri and Kane goes to the floor. Del Rio with a boot to Orton followed by punches. Del Rio misses a running boot and Orton with punches.</p>
<p>Orton with a kick and two clotheslines. Kane tries for a clothesline on Orton but Orton ducks it and then Orton hits a power slam on Kane. Orton gives one to Del Rio so he does not feel left out. Orton with a clothesline that sends Kane over the top rope to the floor. Orton with a clothesline in the corner followed by punches.</p>
<p>Orton punches Del Rio on the turnbuckles and Orton with an IEDDT. Orton looks around and sets for the RKO with the twist. Orton punches the mat but Del Rio pushes Orton away. Kane pulls Orton to the floor. Kane Irish whips Orton into the ring steps. Kane drops Del Rio on the top rope.</p>
<p>Kane goes up top but he misses the leaping clothesline. Del Rio with a kick and then he tries to float over into the cross arm breaker but Kane avoids it and he hits the choke slam on Del Rio. Daniel Bryan comes to the ring and Kane does not know whether to try to win the match or go after Bryan. Kane leaves the ring and then he realizes what is going on. Kane gets back on the apron and Bryan makes his way back down the ramp.</p>
<p>Kane freezes on the apron and then Orton hits an RKO on Kane. Orton makes the cover but Del Rio with a running boot to break up the cover. Del Rio gets the three count on Kane.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>Alberto celebrates on the stage but Sheamus with a running double sledge to the back of Del Rio. Sheamus tells Del Rio that he cannot wait to kick his head off at No Way Out.</p>

<p><strong>411&rsquo;s WWE SmackDown Report 5.25.12</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Colin Rinehart on 05.25.2012</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio battled Kane and Randy Orton for a World Title shot, Sheamus went one-on-one with Jack Swagger, Christian made his in-ring return to Smackdown and more! Check out 411&rsquo;s full WWE Smackdown report for all the details!</p>
<p>WWE Friday Night SmackDown<br>
May 25th, 2012<br>
Mohegan Sun Arena, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania<br>
Attendance: Unknown at this time</p>
<p>Welcome back everyone to another edition of 411mania&rsquo;s Friday Night Smackdown coverage. I&rsquo;ll be your guide to the world of the blue brand as usual as we&rsquo;re less than a week removed from the Over the Limit PPV which saw Sheamus retain his World Heavyweight title in a four-way match among others. The build to the next PPV, No Way Out, should begin for the brand tonight so let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s in store for us.</p>
<p>Your hosts are Michael Cole, Booker T, and Josh Matthews</p>
<p>We open the show tonight with the assistant GM Eve coming out to gloat a bit about John Laurinaitis&rsquo; victory over John Cena at Over the Limit, despite the fact that Johnny isn&rsquo;t here tonight (again), so Eve is in charge. She promises that tonight Sheamus will apologize for tackling Ace on RAW this week, and that we&rsquo;ll also decide who the new number one contender is. Alberto Del Rio promptly comes out as soon as she says this to suck up and try to get the title shot. Since this is the opening segment of Smackdown and that means we need atleast 3-4 interruptions, out comes Randy Orton to try and lay claim to the shot. And now here comes Kane, who&mdash;yep, you guessed it, wants the title shot for himself, but atleast he&rsquo;s got a clever reason&mdash;tonight is the 666th episode of Smackdown. Eve decides to just book them all into a triple threat match for our main event tonight, with the winner becoming number one contender.</p>
<p>Santino Marella (7-5) vs. Ricardo Rodriguez (0-0)</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but notice how much more over Ricardo is then Del Rio. This match came out of an announcing dispute on RAW, if you missed it. Nice leap-frog from Ricardo in the tux to start and they go into a rope-running sequence, but Santino just stops and let Ricardo tire himself out. Airplane spin from Santino but he trips and falls out of the ring himself. He tries hiding under the ring apron and then pops back into the ring behind Ricardo to nail him with The Cobra for the win at 1:52. A comedy match that was actually funny, that&rsquo;s a rarity these days. I really have no idea why they put the US title on Santino though if they&rsquo;re just going to continue to use him as a comedy act. *</p>
<p>Before the main event can actually start though, Daniel Bryan jumps Kane from behind in the dark with a steel chair and waffles the everloving hell out of him while the crowd chants &ldquo;YES! YES! YES!&rdquo; in appreciation. Well that was&hellip;random.</p>
<p>World Heavyweight Title Number One Contender&rsquo;s Match</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio (11-10) vs. Kane (18-13) vs. Randy Orton (31-11-1)</p>
<p>Orton sends Del Rio out of the ring quickly but turns around into a big boot and dropkick from Kane. Del Rio returns to the ring only to be clotheslined out by Orton, who is then clotheslined out by Kane. Orton drags Kane back to the apron and tries for the second rope DDT, but Del Rio hits a spin kick to Orton to break it up as we take our last commercial break. When we return Kane is back in control. Orton dropkicks Del Rio out of the ring but walks right into a sideslam from the Big Red Machine. Kane heads to the top rope but Del Rio hits his step-up enziguri, sending him crashing out to the floor. Kane quickly returns to the ring and Orton hands out powerslams to both him and Alberto. Second-rope DDT on Del Rio from Orton out of the corner and he sets up for the RKO, but Del Rio blocks it and Kane sends Orton crashing into the steel steps outside the ring. Kane blocks the cross armbar attempt from Del Rio and hits him with the chokeslam, but Daniel Bryan runs back down to the apron to distract him and Kane takes off to chase him. He returns to the ring and walks right into the RKO from Orton, but before Orton can cover him Del Rio kicks Orton right in the head and steals the pin and the title shot at 7:20 (shown). Meh, this was decent enough but there was just zero flow whatsoever here, this just felt like a few spots strung together in the loosest of ways. Just chaos, and not the good kind. **</p>
<p>Del Rio celebrates on the ramp after the match when Sheamus comes out to jump him from behind as we go off the air.</p>

<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: DREW GETS UPSET AND THEN HE GETS UPSET WHICH UPSETS KELLY KELLY; HATS ARE THROWN INTO THE ROYAL RUMBLE; EDGE AND DOLPH ON THE CUTTING EDGE AS DIRTY LAUNDRY IS AIRED; ET TU ZEKE?</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-01-14 22:01:13</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Birmingham, Alabama and your announcers are Matt ‘Home State of the National Champion Auburn Tigers’ Striker, Michael ‘Why Can’t the Miz be on this show too’ Cole and Josh ‘Who will be the ‘Josh Mathews’ of the new Tough Enough’ Mathews.</p>
<p>While Alberto Del Rio comes to the ring, Cole, Mathews, and Striker talk about what Alberto did on Raw on Monday night when Alberto confronted Shawn Michaels. Their accounts of what happened differ slightly.</p>
<p>Alberto reminds us his name and Cole steps on his line. Alberto says that the people in the South are a bit slow. However, they know that there is no one like him on Raw or Smackdown. He tells everyone not to get angry because it isn’t his fault. It is his destiny. He will destroy their dreams and their hero’s dreams when he wins the Royal Rumble. He told Shawn Michaels that after he wins, he will be known as the new Mr. Wrestlemania.</p>
<p>Truth says that the Royal Rumble is a few weeks away but Del Rio has lost his mind. Truth tells Pancho that Alberto can’t win Royal Rumble because you have a bunch of fancy cars. You can’t win the Royal Rumble because you have a creepy creepy ring announcer. You can’t win because of destiny. A championship match on the world’s biggest stage isn’t something you can buy or inherit, you have to earn that on your own. You earn that by stepping up to the plate like a man. The man that Alberto can’t be.</p>
<p>Cody Rhodes comes out to the ring after making sure that he is truly ‘dashing’. He tells Alberto and Truth that dashing is in at the Royal Rumble and everyone else is out. If you don’t look like him, you are going over the top rope to your ungroomed and undashing lifestyles. Cody says that he is twenty-five but he has already been in three Rumble matches. He says that he is the face that will main event Wrestlemania.</p>
<p>Rey Mysterio comes out and he wants to get something straight. Winning the Royal Rumble isn’t about looking like a diva as he addresses Cody. He tells Alberto that it isn’t about destiny. Rey says that it is about beating the odds. It is about surviving and that is what Rey has been doing his whole entire life.</p>
<p>Alberto tells Rey that no one wants to hear his inspirational stories and he will beat him like the dog he is. Rey asks Alberto how many Royal Rumbles he has won and Rey points out that he hasn’t won any. Rey mentions that he won a Royal Rumble.</p>
<p>Cody says that Rey winning the Royal Rumble is so 2006. Just like the fashion of 2006, he is out of style. He tells Truth that is ‘what’s up’.</p>
<p>Truth wants to know if we are stealing catch phrases and he punches Cody. All four men fight with Rey and Cody pairing up while Truth and Del Rio fight on the other side of the ring.</p>
<p>Teddy Long comes out and says that if they want to mix it up, they will do it in the ring. Alberto Del Rio and Cody Rhodes will face R Truth and Rey Mysterio in a tag match.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number One: Alberto Del Rio and Cody Rhodes versus Rey Mysterio and R Truth</strong></p>
<p>Cody and Rey start things off and they lock up with Cody backing Rey into the corner and Cody with a kick instead of a clean break. Cody with a side head lock and shoulder tackle. Rey blocks a punch and then Rey with kicks and forearms. Rey follows that with shoulders in the corner and a kick. Rey with a drop kick into the corner. Del Rio tags in and Del Rio kicks Rey and then he sends Rey into the turnbuckles. Del Rio with a snap mare and kick to the back for a near fall. Del Rio with knees to the midsection and Cody’s attempt to interfere backfires but Del Rio sends Rey under the bottom rope to the floor.</p>
<p>Del Rio Irish whips Rey into the ringside barrier and they return to the ring and Del Rio gets a near fall. Cody tags back in and he punches Rey in the ribs and head. Rhodes with a boot to the chest but he misses the Ric Flair knee drop. Rey goes up top but Cody stops him with a forearm. Cody tries for a superplex but Rey holds on to the turnbuckle and Rey with a head butt to knock Cody off and Rey with a cross body. Both men are down but they are able to make the tag.</p>
<p>Truth with clotheslines to Del Rio followed by a punch and hip toss. Truth with a sit out gourdbuster for a near fall. Truth sends Del Rio over the top rope to the floor and then Cody tries to charge at Truth but Truth ducks down and Cody goes to the floor as well. Truth hands things over to Rey who hits an Asai Moonsault onto Del Rio and Rhodes. Truth and Rey celebrate in the ring as we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Del Rio punches and kicks Truth before he sends Truth into his corner and he tags in Cody. Cody hits a gourdbuster but Truth with a drop toe hold and punches to the head. Truth with a forearm to Rhodes and then to Del Rio on the apron. Cody with a shoulder tackle to Truth while Rodriguez fans Del Rio on the floor.</p>
<p>Rhodes with a series of boots to Truth’s chest. Rhodes with a series of jabs to Truth. Del Rio tags in and hits a drop kick on Truth and gets another near fall. Del Rio with a belly-to-back suplex for a near fall. Del Rio with a rear chin lock. Truth with a few punches but Del Rio sends Truth back to the mat. Cody tags in and he gets between Truth and his corner to prevent the tag. Rhodes with knees to the midsection as he goes off the ropes and then Cody with a side Russian leg sweep for a near fall. Cody with a body scissors and arm bar on Truth.</p>
<p>Truth gets Cody up and hits the electric chair drop and both men are down again. Cody gets to his feet first but Truth is the first to tag and Rey hits a seated splash on Cody and then he knocks Del Rio off the apron. Rey with kicks followed by a springboard cross body for a near fall.</p>
<p>Rhodes with a knee and Irish whip but he runs into a boot. Rey with a sunset flip and this time Rhodes rolls through and tries for a rollup but Rey counters it and gets a near fall of his own that is broken up by a drop kick from Del Rio. All four men are in the ring and Truth with a leg lariat to Del Rio to send him to the floor. Rhodes clotheslines Truth to the floor before returning his attention to the legal man in the match. Cody catches Rey as he comes off the ropes and sets for the Alabama Slam but Rey counters with a head scissors that sends Cody into the ropes. Rey with the 619 followed by the springboard dive and the three count.</p>
<p>Winners: Rey Mysterio and R Truth</p>
<p>After the match, Alberto is on the floor showing his anger over losing to Rey and Truth.</p>

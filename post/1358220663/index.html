<p><strong>COMPLETE WWE RAW 20TH ANNIVERSARY SHOW REPORT: VIDEO PACKAGES; A CONCERT; A NEW CHAMP; TAG CHAMPS MEET WITH DR. SHELBY AND THEN TAKE OUT THEIR ANGER ISSUES ON THEIR OPPONENTS AT THE ROYAL RUMBLE; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-01-14 20:12:54</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, professional wrestling changed with the debut of a show from the Manhattan Center in New York City. Who would have known that a young man named Mike Johnson would go from attending that show to being one of the pillars of the internet wrestling community. Who will be the person in Houston to be the next Mike Johnson for the 40th anniversary of Raw?</p>
<p>We begin with a montage of the Raw opens through the years.</p>
<p>We are in Houston, Texas and your announcers are Michael ‘Where is the Harlem part of this town’ Cole, John ‘Welcome to my state’ Layfield, and Jerry ‘Biggio and Bagwell were robbed’ Lawler.</p>
<p>It is starting to feel a lot like 1993 because Vince McMahon is in the ring. Vince welcomes everyone to the twentieth anniversary of Monday Night Raw. We have seen a lot in twenty years. Most of all, we have seen entertainment. Raw has been so entertaining that since its inception, four billion viewers have watched Raw.</p>
<p>Why have over four billion viewers enjoyed Raw? Because Vince is a certifiable iconic genius. He also says that it is because of the fans. They will continue to make history tonight. Dolph Ziggler will face John Cena tonight. It will be in a steel cage. We will have a Rock Concert tonight.</p>
<p>Vince is interrupted by the former World Champion, the Big Show. Show tells Vince that he is sorry but the twentieth anniversary celebration will have to wait. They need to address the travesty that happened to him on Smackdown.</p>
<p>Vince reminds Show that he does not like being told what to do. He does not like being interrupted. He does not like certain people calling him Vince.</p>
<p>Show says ‘sir’ and then he continues. He would like to address what happened on Smackdown.</p>
<p>Vince tells Show that he looks good and he has lost some weight. He says that Show is no longer carrying the World Championship.</p>
<p>Show says that is why he his out here. He wants to address the travesty.</p>
<p>Vince wants to roll the footage and Show says that it isn’t necessary. Since he came out unannounced, they don’t have the footage ready.</p>
<p>Vince says that we need to watch the footage.</p>
<p>Show says that is what he is talking about. He wasn’t prepared for that type of match on Smackdown. Why would Booker put him in that match. Maybe he is trying to make Del Rio a hero to the Latinos. It is not fair. Booker is jealous of him. He has a no cut iron clad contract. Booker and everyone is inferior to him.</p>
<p>Vince asks Show what he would have him do.</p>
<p>Show says that since he is Vince’s most precious commodity, Vince should strip the inferior Alberto Del Rio of his title.</p>
<p>Ricardo Rodriguez comes out and he introduces the current World Champion, Albertooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Del Riooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.</p>
<p>Alberto tells Big Show for someone who talks about being a giant so much, he comes off so small. He remembers that Show had so much fun picking on Ricardo, but when someone picks on him, Show becomes a crying baby. Instead of complaining to Mr. McMahon, why not do something about that. Why not give the people Alberto Del Rio versus Big Show for the title tonight?</p>
<p>Show says no. This is exactly what he has been talking about. He was not prepared on Friday. He is not prepared tonight. He is wearing a custom made suit.</p>
<p>Del Rio says that Show is bigger and stronger than him. For once in his life, he tells Show to show some cajones.</p>
<p>Show says that he is not going to waste his rematch here tonight and he tells Del Rio that he is delusional to think that. He will fight Del Rio when he wants to fight him, not when Del Rio wants to fight him. A perfect place for that title is not in Houston, it is at the Royal Rumble.</p>
<p>A smart man like himself, chooses the battleground. When it is all said and done, people won’t be talking about CM Punk, the Rock, or who survived the 30 man Royal Rumble . . . they will be talking about him because he is going to knock Del Rio out and take back his World Championship. He tells Del Rio to enjoy his fifteen minutes of fame.</p>
<p>Alberto says something in Spanish and he translates for Show and says that he called him a fat jackass in Spanish.</p>
<p>Show asks if this is Vince’s World Champion to insult him.</p>
<p>Alberto says that Ricardo has a present for Show. Ricardo gets a bucket and Show tells Ricardo if he throws water on him, he will break Ricardo’s spine in half.</p>
<p>Ricardo thinks about it and he throws confetti on Show. Del Rio and Show battle and Del Rio with a rana and a step up enzuigiri.</p>

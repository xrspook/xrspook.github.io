<p><strong>COMPLETE WWE EXTREME RULES PPV COVERAGE</strong></p>
<p>By Mike Johnson on 2013-05-19 22:50:00</p>
<p>Welcome to PWInsider&rsquo;s ongoing coverage of the 2013 WWE Extreme Rules PPV.</p>
<p>Pre-Game Show</p>
<p>They had a panel discussing the PPV featuring Renee Young, Mick Foley, Titus O&rsquo;Neil and Wade Barrett. Foley said it&rsquo;s one of his favorite nights of the year. Barrett pushed the Orton vs. Show match. O&rsquo;Neill said he was looking forward to the Sheamus-Henry Strap match. Foley said he was looking forward to the Last Man Standing match, saying it doesn&rsquo;t get more simple and primitive than that.</p>
<p>They aired a promotional video on Ryback vs. John Cena.</p>
<p>The panel discussed the WWE title match. Barrett predicted that Cena&rsquo;s injury would mean the end of his WWE title run.</p>
<p>The WWE feed seemed to crash as they were promoting a Facebook poll.</p>
<p>The pre-show never returned, at least for me. I checked WWE.com, the WWE App and Youtube.</p>
<p>The PPV started with a great video piece.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Swagger vs. Alberto Del Rio: I Quit Match</strong></p>
<p>Zeb Colter cut a promo on the government for letting the IRS target certain groups and for tapping the AP&rsquo;s phones. He asked who was going to jail and ripped on the fans for allowing it to happen. He blamed St. Louis and The Cardinals for allowed foreign born players to come here and then take their money back home. He said that when fans support them and Alberto Del Rio, it just proves they have given up on America. He promised Swagger would make Del Rio quit in two languages and send him back to Mexico. They are then going to go hunting for Dolph Ziggler and the World title. Great promo. Colter is great.</p>
<p>They started out hit with Swagger being clotheslined over the top to the floor and Del Rio nailing a tope to the outside. Del Rio began using a Singapore Cane. Swagger got the better of it and worked Alberto over but he didn&rsquo;t want to quit. Swagger exposed the metal under the barrier and tried to suplex Del Rio onto it but Swagger was sent into the stairs and worked over but he refused to quit.</p>
<p>They returned to the ring where Swagger worked him over hard with the cane. He choked Del Rio against the ringpost but Alberto refused. Swagger began focusing his attack on Del Rio&rsquo;s leg as a way to soften it up for the Patriot Act. Del Rio finally blocked an attack but was quickly cut off and tied up in the ropes. Swagger beat him again and again with the cane but Del Rio refused to quit. He was released from the ropes and grabbed Swagger in the armbreaker while hanging over the ropes. There was no rope break but Swagger finally nailed him with the stick to break it.</p>
<p>Del Rio was worked over but ducked a running kick. Del Rio unloaded a ton of offensive maneuvers. He tied up Swagger against the ropes and beat him with the cane, then nailed a backstabber with it while using the cane for additional leverage.</p>
<p>Swagger came back with an amateur takedown. Swagger nailed a Vader splash out of the corner, followed by a Doctor Bomb. Del Rio refused to quit. Swagger nailed another Doctor Bomb but again, Del Rio would not quit. He grabbed the cross armbreaker out of nowhere. Swagger turned that into the Patriot Act. Swagger scissored it in the center of the ring. Ricardo teased throwing in the towel and was told not to do it by Del Rio. Colter grabbed it off the apron and threw it in the ring. The ref rang the bell, not seeing who threw it into the ring.</p>
<p>Ricardo protested and a second referee came into the ring. The ref explained that Ricardo did not throw the towel. The referee asked to see an instant replay on a monitor. The referee ruled that if Alberto can continue, they will restart the match. They did a deal with Alberto dramatically pulled himself up and agreed to continue.</p>
<p>Swagger attacked him in the corner but was kicked off. Del Rio kicked him and nailed the rolling cross armbreaker. Swagger tried to roll over and power out but Del Rio pulled him back over. Swagger finally quit.</p>
<p>Your winner, Alberto Del Rio!</p>
<p>Del Rio is now the number one contender to the World title.</p>
<p>Good match with some really vicious shots and good storytelling and brawling. The instant replay deal come off unique but now if every screwy finish from this point on doesn&rsquo;t get overturned&hellip;.</p>

Colter starts ripping the St. Louis Cardinals and says they should be called the Caribbean Cardinals because of the roster. Colter says tonight, Swagger will make Alberto Del Rio quit in two languages then they will ship him off to where he came from. Colter says then they will go hunting for Dolph Ziggler and the World Title. Swagger&rsquo;s America has begun, Colter says. Ricardo Rodriguez is out next to begin the introduction for Alberto Del Rio.</p>

Del Rio applies the cross armbreaker out of nowhere but Swagger won&rsquo;t quit. Swagger turns it into the Patriot Lock but Del Rio won&rsquo;t quit either. Swagger falls back on the ankle but Del Rio still won&rsquo;t give up. Del Rio tells Ricardo not to throw the towel in. Zeb interferes, throws a towel in and makes it look like Ricardo threw it in. The referee sees this and thinks Ricardo threw in the towel for Del Rio.</p>
<p>Winner and New #1 Contender: Jack Swagger</p>
<p>After the match, another referee runs out and explains what happened. The referee goes to the timekeeper and asks the truck to replay what happened. He watches on a monitor and sees what really happened. He says if Del Rio can continue, the match will re-start. The match is restarted after Del Rio is able to get to his feet. Swagger goes right back to the leg and works him over. Del Rio nails a superkick to the arm. Del Rio hobbles over and applies the cross armbreaker. Swagger almost quits but counters the hold. Del Rio locks it in tighter and Swagger finally quits.</p>

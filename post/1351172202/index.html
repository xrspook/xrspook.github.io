<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: FELIZ ANIVERSARIO ALBERTO; WE HAVE AN OFFICIAL NUMBER ONE CONTENDER; KIDD/GABRIEL AGAIN; NATALYA TAKES OUT HER FRUSTRATIONS ON ONE OF THE BARBIE LOOKING DIVAS</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-08-19 21:56:44</p>
<p>We start off with a look at what happened on Sunday when Randy Orton became the World Heavyweight Champion after defeating Christian at SummerSlam. What will happen?</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Bakersfield, California and your announcers are Josh ‘Happy Birthday Dad’ Mathews, Michael ‘Gimmicks don’t always equal good commentary’ Cole, and Booker ‘Mushmouth’ T.</p>
<p>The announcers talk about how Alberto Del Rio is coming home to Smackdown and that leads us into a video package about WWE returning to South Africa, Justin Gabriel’s home country. He says that he hasn’t been back to South Africa in three years. We see Justin all over the country.</p>
<p>We are back and Ricardo Rodriguez introduces the WWE Champion Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>Alberto tells us who he is . . . but we already knew that. He tells us that the is the Undisputed WWE Champion. He says that he has been talking about destiny for month. People might have thought that he was crazy, but he is here in front of the crowd to prove to everyone that destiny is real.</p>
<p>He says that he cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase at SummerSlam to become the Undisputed WWE Champion. He says that he is ‘your’ champion because of what Bakersfield means to Alberto. Alberto says that he debuted in this building last year. He defeated Rey Mysterio in his debut and he says that he remembers how everyone hated him.</p>
<p>Things have changed in a year because everyone loves Alberto. Alberto says that it is funny that a year ago he defeated Rey Mysterio. Then a year later, he beat Rey Mysterio in his first title defense. Alberto says that if the people don’t believe him, we have the footage of the match from Monday night.</p>
<p>Alberto and Ricardo like what they see while the people of Bakersfield disagree. Alberto says that he is a real champion. A real champion faces anyone. Alberto wants to know who wants to face El Padron Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>Daniel Bryan’s music plays and he comes out to the stage.</p>
<p>Del Rio wants to know if Bryan is kidding him. He asks Bryan if he wants another beat down and he calls him a dog.</p>
<p>Bryan says that Alberto thinks that he is so special. Bryan wants to know why Del Rio cashed in his briefcase like everyone else when the champion was beaten and broken so he had to pick up the bones. He says that is not special. It is ordinary and predictable so it is pathetic.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>

<p><strong>RAW REPORT: VISA ISSUES FOR A TOP STAR; MATCHES ANNOUNCED FOR VENGEANCE; THE STIPULATION FOR CENA/DEL RIO IS ANNOUNCED; THE CROWD REALLY GOT INTO THE MAIN EVENT</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-10-17 23:04:11</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Mexico City, Mexico and your announcers are Michael ‘Why is everyone offering me water’ Cole and Jerry ‘Mantiquilla’ Lawler.</p>
<p>John Laurinaitis is introduced and he makes his way to the ring and Mexico does not love the General Manager. We have a video package.</p>
<p>John throws out a que pasa and then he introduces himself to the people of Mexico City. He says that tonight marks the return of Rey Mysterio. Rey returns to San Diego to meet with his doctor about rehab. Laurinaitis says that the Mexican people don’t have a sense of humor. John says that he will do whatever it takes to maintain honor and integrity to Raw. He says that he will not let the board down and he will not let the fans down.</p>
<p>John says that he will make some mistakes and he asks for their understanding. John says that he made a mistake last week by firing Jim Ross. John says that he received a number of tweets about it. As a result, he listened to the fans and he is going to do this for the people. He is bringing back Good Ole JR.</p>
<p>John wants Jim to come to the ring for a public apology. John hugs Jim and Kelly Kelly has a warm feeling someplace because she started the hugging. John says that he shouldn’t have fired Jim Ross like that last week. He says that it was unprofessional so he wanted to bring him back. Jim will not be on commentary tonight.</p>
<p>John says that he has something to show Jim. We see Michael Cole, Alberto Del Rio, and Ricardo Rodriguez and Cole serenades JR.</p>
<p>We see Cole laughing at what he did. John says that he doesn’t know what the issue is between Jim and Cole, but everything should be settled tonight on Raw. The main event will be Michael Cole and Alberto Del Rio versus Jim Ross and John Cena.</p>
<p>John gets back on the phone and he shuns Ricardo away as he introduces Alberto Del Rio. Alberto says that teaming with Michael Cole against John Cena and Jim Ross is crazy. Ricardo agrees. John says that Alberto has to understand him. The winner of the match gets to pick the stipulation for the match on Sunday at Vengeance.</p>
<p>John Cena and Jim Ross are in the locker room. Ross says that he doesn’t want to screw things up for Cena on Sunday. Cena says that JR is the greatest voice in WWE history. Cena tells JR that he can just stand in the corner while Cena takes care of Del Rio. Ross says that he would like to get his hands on the sniveling rodent-like, smarmy son of a bitch. Cena says that he will do that for Ross.</p>
<p>Michael Cole takes his chance to address Jim Ross’ comments. He says that he will take JR and his egotistical body and put him out of his miseries. He says that he might even do something to John Cena. Cole mentions that his wife is Mexican so they have to cheer for him.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Josh Mathews joins Jerry Lawler at the announce table. We see that Smackdown is now the second longest episodic television and Raw will hit 1,000 shows in less than a year.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Six: John Cena and Jim Ross versus Alberto Del Rio and Michael Cole in a Winner Picks the Stipulation for the WWE Title Match on Sunday Match</strong></p>
<p>Cole wants to start the match against Ross, but Cena is staying with his game plan, or maybe not. Ross starts off and Cole has something to say to Ross and Ross with a punch. Del Rio and Cena tag in.</p>
<p>They lock up and Del Rio with a side head lock and hip toss for a near fall. Cena with a side head lock. Del Rio with a hip toss of his own and he gets a near fall. Del Rio with a reverse chin lock. Cena with a belly-to-back suplex for a near fall and then Cena with a reverse chin lock. Del Rio with a belly-to-back suplex and he gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a reverse chin lock but Cena with a gutwrench suplex for a near fall. Cena goes into the corner when Del Rio moves and Del Rio with kicks to Cena. Del Rio sends Cena into the turnbuckles and he hits Cena in the kidneys. Cole with a forearm to the back when the referee is not looking. Del Rio chokes Cena with his boot and then Cena goes to the apron. Del Rio with a punch to Cena and the referee warns him. Del Rio gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio from the turnbuckles with a double axe handle and he gets a near fall. Del Rio mocks Cena’s you can’t see me before he continues to work over Cena. Cena powers out of the chin lock but Del Rio with a kick. Cena gets Del Rio up for an Attitude Adjustment but Del Rio counters and hits a German suplex and bridge for a near fall. Del Rio kicks Cena in the back.</p>
<p>Cena with a drop toe hold and he tries for the STF. Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker and he gets a near fall. Del Rio hits the running enzuigiri in the corner and he gets a near fall. Del Rio goes up top but he misses the back senton and both men are down.</p>
<p>Cena with the flying shoulder tackles followed by the Blue Thunder Bomb. Cena with the Five Knuckle Shuffle and then he sets for the Attitude Adjustment but Del Rio is able to tag in Cole.</p>
<p>Cena brings Cole into the ring and Cole begs for mercy and he wants Cena to shake his hand. Cena shakes his hand and then he puts Cole in the Attitude Adjustment and he hits it. Cena thinks about the STF but he sees Ross on the apron and Jim is tagged in. Ross puts Cole in the ankle lock and Cole taps out.</p>
<p>Winners: Jim Ross and John Cena</p>
<p>After the match, Del Rio pulls Cena to the floor but Cena gives Del Rio an Attitude Adjustment on the floor. Cena takes the mic and he counts to ten. Del Rio gets up and Cena with a clothesline and then he grabs the steps and he hits Del Rio in the head with them. Cena announces that the stipulation for the match at Vengeance will be a Last Man Standing Match.</p>

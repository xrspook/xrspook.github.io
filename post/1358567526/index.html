<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: THE SHOW JOINS THE 700 CLUB . . . ARE BOOKER AND TEDDY &lsquo;JIM AND TAMMY&rsquo;?; FIESTA DEL RIO; THE SHIELD HAVE ANOTHER MESSAGE; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-01-18 21:55:18</p>
<p>The Rock will be on Smackdown . . . at least he will be on Smackdown in taped form from his Rock Concert on Monday night. On to the people who will be in the building tonight . . .</p>
<p>Last week, Alberto Del Rio shocked the world (who did not read WWE.com or PWInsider.com) by winning the World Title from Big Show. What will happen as we continue on the Road to the Royal Rumble, also known as the Road to Having the Ability to Point to the Wrestlemania Sign First? What kind of fiesta will we see for Alberto? Will anyone be a party pooper?</p>
<p>We are in San Antonio, Texas and your announcers are Josh ‘Is Manu Ginobili related to Manu from the Heavy Breathing Clip on The Soup’ Mathews and John ‘Did you know that I am from Texas? If not I will tell you fifty times tonight’ Layfield.</p>
<p>We have a mariachi band in the ring as well as a dancer and many red, white, and green balloons. Ricardo Rodriguez is in the center of the ring and he brings out the man who took the World Title belt off Big Show, and the guest of honor for the Fiesta Del Rio.</p>
<p>Alberto and Ricardo hug when Alberto gets into the ring. Alberto welcomes everyone to Fiesta Del Rio. He says that it is time for San Antonio to party. Alberto says that they have not always seen eye to eye over the years, but he says that they will have to agree that they need to celebrate because the fat jackass of Smackdown is no longer the World Champion.</p>
<p>Dolph Ziggler, AJ Lee, and Big E Langston come out and they are going to poop on the party. Dolph wants to know if someone said fiesta. AJ says that her and Ziggy love to party and they assume that their invitations were lost.</p>
<p>Alberto says that this is his party.</p>
<p>Dolph says that it is funny that he thinks these people are his friends and that he holds the World Title. He is the man with a target and Dolph has the contract. Whenever he sees fit to cash in the contract, Alberto will be saying adios to the championship.</p>
<p>Alberto asks Dolph if he thinks he can cash in the contract and Dolph says si.</p>
<p>Dolph apologizes for being rude and he introduces Big E Langston to Alberto and his little friend Ricardo. Langston says que paso little man.</p>
<p>Alberto tells Ziggler and his party to leave.</p>
<p>Dolph says that they will leave, but maybe Big E will drop Alberto where he stands and Dolph cashes in and leaves with the World Title.</p>
<p>Alberto tells Dolph to try it.</p>
<p>Ziggler starts to take off his sweatshirt but Big Show’s music starts to play.</p>
<p>Show makes his way to the ring and he is fixated on Del Rio and the title belt.</p>
<p>Dolph tells Del Rio that he doesn’t know how good he is at math, but he is outnumbered.</p>
<p>Sheamus’ music plays and he comes out to the ring and he asks Ziggles how he is doing and he wants to fix the numbers situation that Dolph was talking about. Sheamus says that everyone knows that he cannot resist a Fiesta Del Rio . . . especially when he has so many friends in the ring.</p>
<p>Sheamus says that he is not out here to gate crash. He knows that they haven’t always gotten along in the past. Sheamus reminds Alberto that the last time they were here, he tried to steal Alberto’s car. He came out here to congratulate Alberto for his epic victory over the giant last week. He has no doubt that Alberto deserves to be the World Champion.</p>
<p>Sheamus says that it would be an honor for him to be the first to shake his hand. Sheamus offers his hand and Del Rio accepts the offer.</p>
<p>Show continues to stare at Sheamus and Del Rio.</p>
<p>Sheamus says that he will be a bouncer to make sure that the muppets do not get involved tonight.</p>
<p>Del Rio says that he doesn’t want anyone fighting.</p>
<p>Sheamus wants to know if Del Rio is serious, and then Del Rio says maybe a little fighting.</p>
<p>Now that things have gotten to Defcon 2, it is time for Booker T to come out and general managerize in a way that John Layfield will definitely approve.</p>
<p>Booker tells everyone to wait a minute as he makes his way to the ring. He says that it is not going down like this. Booker says that tonight is a party. This is a fiesta. He wants to be serious for one moment. If Big Show ever puts his hands on him again, he will ruin his day . . . sucka.</p>
<p>With that being said, there will be a fight tonight. Big Show will team with Dolph Ziggler to face Sheamus and Alberto Del Rio. That will be the main event tonight. It will be a tag team main event extravaganza.</p>
<p>Booker tells Show, Ziggler, AJ, and Langston to leave the ring because they were not invited to the party.</p>
<p>Booker asks everyone if they are ready to party. It is time for some music and dancing. Alberto tells Booker to do a Spinaroonie and Booker obliges the request of the champion.</p>
<p>Ricardo gets a sombrero and Alberto tells Sheamus to feel a little Mexican today. Sheamus says nobody wants to see him dance, but the crowd is not agreeing with Sheamus. Sheamus says that he has a reputation to keep. Alberto says that everyone wants to see Sheamus dance and Sheamus says that it is a fiesta so the hell with it.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Six: Big Show and Dolph Ziggler (with Big E Langston and AJ Lee) versus Sheamus and Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez)</strong></p>
<p>Del Rio and Ziggler start things off. They lock up and Ziggler works on the arm but Del Rio with a reversal and arm bar. Ziggler with a kick to the knee followed by more kicks and punches in the corner. Ziggler misses a charge into the corner but Del Rio with a slam and he goes to the turnbuckles for a moonsault from the turnbuckles but Ziggler moves. Del Rio rolls through and he tosses Ziggler into the air and Ziggler lands on the mat.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a kick to the ribs and he gets a near fall. Sheamus tags in and he kicks Ziggler and sends him into the turnbuckles. Sheamus with kicks to Ziggler in the corner. Ziggler with a kick but Sheamus with a shoulder tackle. Sheamus with a delayed vertical suplex to Ziggler and he gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Sheamus with an Irish whip but he runs into a boot. Sheamus gets Ziggler up for White Noise but Ziggler escapes and he tags in Show. Show with punches and head butts to Sheamus. Show chokes Sheamus in the ropes and then he connects with a head butt that sends Sheamus to the floor.</p>
<p>Langston tries to send Sheamus into the ring post but Sheamus avoids it and he wants to take a shot at Langston but the referee goes to the floor and he sends Langston to the back. AJ hits the apron with the briefcase and then she gets in the ring and argues with the referee. The referee sends AJ to the back as well.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Ziggler with a side head lock. Del Rio gets to his feet but Ziggler with a kick. Del Rio with a German suplex and bridge for a near fall and both men are down. Sheamus tags in and he hits two running double sledges followed by sending Ziggler into the corner and Sheamus with a clothesline in the corner followed by a short arm clothesline. Sheamus goes up top but Show pushes Sheamus off the turnbuckles to the floor.</p>
<p>Sheamus returns to the ring and Ziggler with kicks to Sheamus. Show tags in and he drops an elbow on Sheamus while Ziggler keeps Sheamus from moving. Show with an elbow to the leg. Show slams Sheamus. Show works on Sheamus’ back and then he stands on Sheamus’ back. Show with an elbow drop to the leg and Sheamus tries to punch Show to get him to release the hold.</p>
<p>Sheamus with forearms across the chest and he gets away from Show. Show with an elbow drop to the back and he keeps Sheamus from making the tag. Show looks at Del Rio and then he gives Sheamus a head butt. Show with knees to stop Sheamus’ punches. Show with a chop across the chest but Sheamus with a punch.</p>
<p>Sheamus with punches but Show with a side slam for a near fall. Show goes to the turnbuckles for the Vader Bomb but Sheamus kicks out. Show goes to the turnbuckles again for the elbow drop but Sheamus moves out of the way.</p>
<p>Sheamus crawls to make the tag and he succeeds while Ziggler tags in. Del Rio with clotheslines and a tilt-a-whirl back breaker. Del Rio with a super kick to Ziggler but Ziggler kicks out. Del Rio signals that it is time for the cross arm breaker but Show makes the tag. Del Rio with the float over into the cross arm breaker and Del Rio does not know that Show made the tag. Show with an elbow drop to force Del Rio to release the hold on Ziggler.</p>
<p>Sheamus with White Noise to Show and Show rolls to the apron. Del Rio with an enzuigiri that sends Show to the floor. Del Rio gets the Mexican bucket from Ricardo and he throws the contents at Show. This time it is not confetti, it is water and Show has had enough and he gets himself counted out.</p>
<p>Winners: Sheamus and Alberto Del Rio (by disqualification)</p>
<p>We go to credits with red, white, and green balloons falling from the rafters.</p>

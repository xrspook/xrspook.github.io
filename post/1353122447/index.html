<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: THREE MATCHES INVOLVING THE ELIMINATION MATCH; SHEAMUS AND SHOW TRY TO SURVIVE UNTIL SUNDAY; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-11-16 21:59:03</p>
<p>Previously in the WWE . . . CM Punk looks to have a celebration on Monday since he will hit day 365 as WWE Champion if he wins on Monday night. Is Miz going to be the X Factor that helps Team Foley past Team Ziggler or will Miz’s addition continue Cleveland’s winning tradition? What is next for Sheamus and Big Show after Big Show injured William Regal.</p>
<p>Sheamus is in the garage and he is waiting for Big Show.</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Cleveland, Ohio and your announcers are Josh ‘Twinsburg’ Mathews and John ‘Moon over Parma’ Layfield.</p>
<p>We have the latest episode of MizTV and it is a hometown edition of the show because Miz is a son of Cleveland.</p>
<p>Miz soaks in the chants from his home town fans. He says that it is good to be home. He welcomes everyone to the most must see show in WWE history . . . MizTv. Miz says in two days, the 26th annual Survivor Series will take place and he is on Team Foley because of the fans. Miz asks if there was any doubt that he would be selected. He is on the poster and it is because he is a survivor. He is a survivor. He has accomplished more than any other Survivor Series participant. He will not follow blindly under any captain, whether it be Dolph Ziggler, or his guest . . . Mick Foley.</p>
<p>Mick makes his way to the ring. Mick appreciates having Miz on his show but he will not mince words. He had some reservations when he put Miz on the ballot. Miz tells Foley not to go for the cheap pop in his home town. Foley asks Miz if he is from right here . . . in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
<p>Foley shows his newest book that features the Miz and he says that if it was written by Charles Dickens, it might have been called A Tale of Two Mizes because that is what Miz is to him. Foley wonders which Miz will show up on Sunday. Will it be the Wrestlemania Main Eventing, John Cena defeating, Awesome Inducing, Self Surviving Superstar that he knows Miz can be or will it be the Vacation Taking, Chair Sitting, Make Up Wearing, Weak Beard Growing Miz who shows up on Raw from time to time. Which Miz will it be.</p>
<p>Miz throws out a few reallys about whether Mick needs to ask that question. Miz says that he is the least of his problems. Foley has a tag team that does not like each other, you have and apex predator that does not play well with others, and he has a cheap shot artist who stole is Intercontinental Title from him.</p>
<p>Mick says that he is glad that he called for a team meeting right now. Foley brings out his team. Out first is Kofi Kingston. He is followed by Kane and Daniel Bryan. Out last is Randy Orton.</p>
<p>Mick says that he wants to open the lines of communication among the team members.</p>
<p>Kane and Bryan want to start talking at the same time. Bryan says that Kane wants to apologize for saying that Daniel Bryan is the weak link on their team.</p>
<p>Kane says that he wants to thank Miz for being his tag team partner on Monday and Kane says that his back is so strong because he didn’t have to carry somebody in the match.</p>
<p>Bryan says that Kane would be roaming basements and scaring little children and if it wasn’t for him.</p>
<p>Kane says that he would be roaming basements and scaring little children regardless of Daniel Bryan.</p>
<p>We then get dueling pronouncements that Kane and Daniel Bryan Am the Tag Team Champions.</p>
<p>Kofi tells them to be a team.</p>
<p>Miz throws out a few reallys and he wants to know why Kofi is playing the peacekeeper now. Last week when he offered his hand to Kofi, Kofi kicked him in the face.</p>
<p>Kofi tells Miz to take a few steps back or he will do it again.</p>
<p>Mick offers the voice of reason on the team, Randy Orton, an opportunity to talk.</p>
<p>Randy says that he has spat in his face numerous amounts of times. Mick threw him on a pile of thumbtacks. He says that he likes Foley more than any of the other people standing in the ring right now. There isn’t a single member of this team that he likes . . . or trusts.</p>
<p>Orton punches the poster that features Miz.</p>
<p>It is time for eighty percent of Team Ziggler to make their presence known. They are joined by Ricardo Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Ziggler says that what is standing in the ring is the definition of dysfunction. He says that is pretty sad even for Foley. Team Ziggler does not have any egos. They are elite superstars standing united behind one charismatic leader.</p>
<p>Ziggler tells Del Rio to focus on what he is saying. He wants to know what Alberto’s problem is.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he does not think that Dolph deserves to be the leader of this team. Alberto says that there is only one person who deserves to be the team leader.</p>
<p>Ziggler says that it would have been nice if he had brought that up in back.</p>
<p>Del Rio points out that he is a former WWE Champion and Ziggler says that he is a future World Champion.</p>
<p>Mick says that Dolph is showing them how to be united. Mick says that he is involved in this. When he used to run this place he got to make some good matches. He asked Booker for the opportunity to make some pretty good matches . . . in Cleveland, Ohio. He says that as long as Dolph says that it is okay.</p>
<p>Mick says that Dolph and Alberto need to start showing that they can get along so it will be Alberto Del Rio and Dolph Ziggler will face two people who need to get along, Miz and Randy Orton.</p>
<p>Dolph says that is fine. He is glad that Miz quit Team Ziggler because he could not cut it. They got someone way better than Miz, Wade Barrett.</p>
<p>Wade tells Dolph that he is making him blush. Team Ziggler replaced the quitter with a winner.</p>
<p>Mick says that he wants to see how Wade stacks up against one half of the tag team champions when he faces Kane.</p>
<p>Daniel Bryan does not like that decision.</p>
<p>Damien Sandow demands SILENCE. He says that it is obvious that Team Foley is in complete disarray. They have a goat faced one word wonder running around with an anger problem. His tag team partner’s unbridled brutality is the reason why Cody Rhodes is not with them this evening. You have a braided neon mute who now claims that he has the ability to fly.</p>
<p>Kofi interrupts and he expects Damien to say something smarter than that. If Damien is willing to question his flight abilities, he will show him.</p>
<p>Foley says the first match tonight will be Kofi Kingston versus Damien Sandow and it starts now.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Three: Randy Orton and The Miz versus Dolph Ziggler and Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez)</strong></p>
<p>Miz and Ziggler start off to show who is the dominant wrestler from Ohio. They lock up and Ziggler works on the arm and he applies a hammer lock and side head lock.

<p>We are back and Ziggler with a reverse chin lock on Orton. Orton with elbows and a head butt but Ziggler with a knee to the midsection. Ziggler takes his time and hits a leaping elbow drop and he gets a near fall. Del Rio tags in and he kicks Orton in the shoulder. Del Rio kicks Orton in the corner.

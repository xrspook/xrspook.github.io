<p><strong>COMPLETE WWE BRAGGING RIGHTS PPV COVERAGE: RANDY ORTON VS. WADE BARRETT, NEW TAG TEAM CHAMPIONS CROWNED, TEAM SMACKDOWN MAKES IT TWO IN A ROW AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Mike Johnson on 2010-10-24 22:44:00</p>
<p>ELIMINATION BOUT FOR WWE BRAGGING RIGHTS TROPHY: TEAM RAW’S THE MIZ &amp; CM PUNK &amp; SHEAMUS &amp; R TRUTH &amp; SANTINO MARELLA &amp; JOHN MORRISON &amp; EZEKIEL JACKSON (with Alex Riley) vs. TEAM SMACKDOWN’S BIG SHOW &amp; REY MYSTERIO &amp; EDGE &amp; ALBERTO DEL RIO &amp; TYLER REKS &amp; JACK SWAGGER &amp; KOFI KINGSTON (with Hornswoggle)</p>
<p>Tyler Reks and John Morrison started the bout, going back and forth early. Morrison blocked a kick and took down Reks for a near fall. Reks shoulderblocked Morrison down and began drilling him with shots to the mid-section. Morrison nailed a jawbreaker and nailed a spinning kick. He tagged in Santino Marella. The pair set up Reks for a Morrison dropkick. Santino went for the Cobra but Reks killed him and nailed the Burning Hammer scoring the pin.</p>
<p>Santino Marella has been eliminated from Team Raw.</p>
<p>Ezekiel Jackson hit the ring and nailed Reks with a back elbow. Jackson had Reks outmatched on power, so Big Show tagged in. Jackson caught him with several punches but Show drilled him down with shots to the back. Show beat down Jackson, then tagged in Rey. Rey nailed a springboard legdrop for a two count. Kofi Kingston tagged in but was overpowered by Jackson.</p>
<p>Sheamus tagged in and beat down Kingston with a slam. Sheamus began peppering Kofi with a series of shots to the chest. Kingston avoided a kick and nailed a bodyblock for a two count.

<p>Kofi Kingston has been eliminated from Team Smackdown.</p>
<p>Mysterio began attacking Sheamus with a series of punches but was killed. CM Punk tagged in and the crowd started chanting his name. Punk worked over Rey. He whipped Rey into the corner but Rey kicked him off. Punk drilled Rey and covered him for a two count, then tagged in Sheamus. Sheamus clotheslined Rey for a two count. Punk tagged in and the crowd chanted for him again. Apparently there are a lot of Chicagoans in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Del Rio tagged in but Punk tricked him into taking out Rey and knocking him off the apron. Del Rio took out Punk, then attacked Rey and threw his own partner into the barricade. Show was angry, screaming at Del Rio for what he did. Officials took Rey out of the ringside area. Del Rio controlled Punk, then tagged in Swagger, who suplexed Punk.</p>

Morrison came back with Starship Pain for the pin.</p>
<p>Jack Swagger has been eliminated from Team Smackdown.</p>
<p>Reks attacked Morrison and began wearing him down on the mat. Morrison flipped out, kicking Reks down. Sheamus tagged in and whipped Reks into the corner but kicked off Sheamus. Lawler asked Striker how big of a star he is on Smackdown and Striker responded, “I’m sorry, I didn’t get to book my own territory.” Sheamus nailed the Brouge Kick and pinned Reks.</p>
<p>Tyler Reks has been eliminated from Team Smackdown,</p>

<p>R Truth and Edge went back and forth. Truth flipped his way out of an Edge charge and nailed his sequence to take out Edge. Killings missed a kick and was speared by Edge, then pinned.</p>
<p>R Truth has been eliminated from Team Raw.</p>
<p>Edge and Morrison went back and forth until Edge speared him as well.</p>
<p>John Morrison has been eliminated from Team Raw.</p>
<p>Punk went for the GTS but Edge escaped and kicked him. Edge went for the spear but missed. Del Rio tagged himself in and attacked Punk. Del Rio went for his finisher but Punk slipped out and nailed a backslide for the pin.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio has been eliminated from Team Smackdown, leaving Edge vs. Team Raw. As Del Rio left, Mysterio attacked him in the aisle and returned to the ring.</p>
<p>Edge dropkicked Punk down and went to make the tag to the “one armed” Rey, but Miz caught off Edge and worked him over. A “Miz is awesome” chant started, which the announcers pointed out. Miz , Jackson and Punk worked over Edge in the Raw corner.</p>
<p>Jackson used his power to smother Edge into the mat. He worked over Edge and tagged in Miz, who nailed Edge with a kick to the head. Miz locked in a side chinlock on Edge. Miz nailed a knee to the back, then a neckbreaker for a two count.</p>
<p>Punk tagged in and began stomping the hell out of Edge. Mysterio finally made the hot tag to Mysterio, who took out Punk with a springboard Thesz Press. Mysterio nailed a springboard cross bodyblock for a two count. Punk whipped him into the corner. Rey went up and over but was caught for a GTS attempt. Rey rolled him through for a pin attempt, setting up a nice back and forth pinfall attempt sequence. Rey finally set Punk up in the ropes and scored the 619 for the pin.</p>
<p>CM Punk was eliminated from Team Raw.</p>
<p>Jackson immediately went after Rey, killing him with his power moves. Mysterio stunned Jasckson with a kick in the corner as he charged. Jackson shrugged it off and continued his assault on Mysterio. Mysterio kicked out Jackson’s knee and went for the 619 but Jackson recovered and shoulderblocked Rey. He grabbed Rey, who pulled him down into a DDT. Rey nailed the 619 on Jackson and a springboard splash for the pin.</p>
<p>Ezekiel Jackson has been eliminated from Team Raw.</p>
<p>Miz immediately attacked Rey. Rey set up for the 619 but Alex Riley tripped him in full view of the referee. Rey set up Miz again but Riley grabbed Miz and took the shot instead. Miz drilled Rey into the mat and scored a two count. Miz went for the Skull Crushing Finale but Rey rolled through, allowing Edge, who recovered after a long time on the floor, speared Miz and scored the pin.</p>
<p>For the second straight year, your winners, Team Smackdown!</p>
<p>Fun back and forth match. I really enjoyed this one a lot, especially the last few minutes. Having the guys wrestle in t-shirts was silly, but beyond that, they did a nice job with the booking, giving Reks and Jackson some strong spots before their eliminations, pushing the Mysterio-Del Rio issues, using Rey as the ultimate sympathetic underdog, positioning Edge as a strong babyface by having him save the day for the team when they were outgunned, and protecting monsters like Show and Sheamus with the only eliminations that weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;clean.&rdquo; The wrestling ranged from OK to good but the overall story was very, very good.</p>

<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: ALBERTO DEL RIO MAKES A BIG IMPACT IN HIS DEBUT; ZIGGLER/KINGSTON CONTINUE THEIR FEUD; IS DREW MCINTYRE GETTING DASHING?; KANE EXPLAINS WHY HE DID IT</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2010-08-20 22:02:18</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Bakersfield, California and your announcers are Matt ‘Cheese’ Striker and Todd ‘You mean it was Kane the whole time’ Grisham.</p>
<p>We see a photos from Sunday when Kane defeated Rey Mysterio only to see the Undertaker return to the ring and he went after the man who attacked him. That man was Kane.</p>
<p>Kane will address the WWE Universe tonight about the tombstone he gave to his brother.</p>
<p>Rey Mysterio comes to the ring and he has something to say to the WWE Universe. Rey starts off by speaking in Spanish to the people of Bakersfield. Rey says that he wants to thank the WWE Universe for helping him get through one of his most grueling matches at SummerSlam. While he did not get the result he wanted, he was not put in a casket. Rey mentions that Kane has accused a lot of people for being responsible for the attack on the Undertaker. In the end we know that he was looking to mask his guilt. Rey says that his name has been cleared. We know that it was Kane who attacked the Undertaker. Rey says that . . .</p>
<p>Rey is interrupted by Alberto Del Rio who makes his way into the arena and he says that tonight is his grand debut on Smackdown. Alberto tells Rey that it is an honor. Rey is a Mexican idol. He is a great luchador. After all their families have been through, they are both here. They are both Mexican icons. He says that he is a national hero, a millionaire, and a man who is admired in Mexico. He says that his family comes from kings. Alberto says that Rey’s blood is from the streets of Tijuana. Alberto says that Rey is like the people of Bakersfield. He is the little worm in his bottle of tequila. He is little and then he tries to grab Rey but Rey tells him not to touch him. Alberto says that Rey is a joke of a man. Alberto says that he is handsome rich, and powerful. He is a man who wears the finest clothing.</p>
<p>Rey says that Alberto’s suit and cufflinks are nice. He says that he has a family member who has the same things but he got them at a swap meet. Rey tells Alberto that he has a lot of guts coming out here to talk about his royal family. Rey tells Alberto that he is a nobody. He says that he has seen Alberto’s type a million times. Just because you have houses all over and wear fine, tailored suits that he has to respect him. Respect is earned around here and as far as he is concerned, Alberto has not gained anyone’s respect.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he does not have to earn anything from Rey or the people. He calls Rey a peasant. Alberto tells Rey that he is going to respect him, or he will make Rey respect him.</p>
<p>Rey tells Alberto that he is not his amigito. If Alberto wants his respect and the fan’s respect, he tells Alberto to come and get it. Rey suggests that he face Alberto tonight in a match.</p>
<p>Alberto thinks about it and he says that he will do it because he can’t wait to squeeze Rey like the little cockroach he is. Alberto winks at Rey and Rey hits Alberto. He knocks Alberto into the ropes and Rey hits a 619 and leaves the ring.</p>
<p>We are back and Alberto Del Rio has his own personal ring announcer and his name is Ricardo Rodriguez. Alberto drives into the arena in a Rolls Royce.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Four: Alberto Del Rio versus Rey Myserio</strong></p>
<p>Del Rio has the patented Del Rio stare as the bell rings and he kicks Rey in the leg and takes him to the mat. Alberto sends Rey into the turnbuckles and kicks him. Alberto punches Rey in the head and snap mares him followed by a kick to the back. Alberto with a hard Irish whip and the referee checks on Rey. Alberto with kicks and forearms. Rey with kicks to Del Rio but Del Rio sends Rey into the turnbuckles. Rey avoids a charge into the corner and then he hits a tilt-a-whirl head scissors on Alberto. Del Rio goes over the top rope to the floor when Rey avoids him. We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Rey with forearms to Del Rio in the corner. Alberto with an Irish whip but he runs into a boot. Alberto sends Rey to the apron but Rey holds on. Albert sends Rey’s arm into the ring post and then he slams Rey’s arm into the ring steps. Alberto stands on the arm as the referee starts his count and Alberto with the Del Rio glare. Del Rio sends Rey back into the ring and he gets a near fall. Alberto with an arm bar on Rey and Rey with kicks to get out of the hold. Rey with kicks to Del Rio but Alberto with an enzuigiri for a near fall. Alberto with a standing hammer lock power slam and then he goes to the top turnbuckles. Del Rio misses a back senton when Rey moves out of the way.</p>
<p>Both men are down on the mat and Rey with punches and knees to Del Rio. Del Rio pushes Rey away but Rey with a running kick to Del Rio’s head and Rey gets a near fall. Rey with the springboard seated senton followed by a springboard cross body for a near fall. Del Rio runs into a drop toe hold and falls into the ropes. Rey tries for the 619 but Alberto grabs Rey’s legs and he tries to catapult Rey into the turnbuckles but Rey lands on the turnbuckles. Rey with a mule kick and both men are down. Rey goes for a double jump moonsault but Alberto clips Rey’s leg and Rey hits the turnbuckles and then the mat as he holds his injured left arm. Del Rio with a kick to the arm and then he takes Rey to the mat with a cross arm breaker and Rey taps out.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>After the match, Del Rio reapplies the cross arm breaker and Rey screams for mercy before Del Rio releases the hold.</p>

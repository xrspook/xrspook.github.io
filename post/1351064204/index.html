<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: CHANGE TO TITLE MATCH AT TLC; FIND OUT HOW THE MIZ SPENDS HIS WEEK; WHAT WILL KANE AND EDGE DO WITHOUT PAUL BEARER AROUND?</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2010-12-17 21:57:54</p>

<p>They argue in Spanish and then Teddy says that they all deserve a shot at the title. If Kane does not show up at the pay per view, Edge, Alberto Del Rio, and Rey Mysterio will be in a Triple Threat TLC Match for the World Title.</p>
<p>Rey doesn’t have a problem with that match. Alberto wants to know what is going to happen if Kane show up. Teddy decides to make it a Fatal Four Way TLC Match at the pay per view.</p>

<p>Teddy Long comes out and he tells everyone to calm down. Teddy reminds Edge that he wanted action tonight. He also points out that Alberto Del Rio has been sticking his nose in Rey’s business. Teddy says that Miz hasn’t proven anything. That means that we will have a tag team match later tonight with Alberto Del Rio and Miz facing Edge and Rey Mysterio.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Five: Alberto Del Rio versus The Miz with Alex Riley versus Rey Mysterio and Edge</strong></p>
<p>6:53 Edge and Miz start things off and they lock up. Edge with a side head lock and shoulder tackle. Edge with a side head lock take down. Miz with a knee to the midsection followed by a forearm.

<p>We go to the back and we see carnage in the hallway. We see Kane walking away so it looks like after injuring his father last week, he is going to torment people he is not related to this week.</p>
<p>Back in the ring, Edge with a drop toe hold to Miz and Rey hits the 619 and Edge with a spear to Miz. Before the referee can make his count, Kane’s pyro goes off and even though Kane is not the fastest man in the world as he comes to the ring, Edge ignores his opponent as he waits for Kane to enter the ring.</p>
<p>Kane takes Edge down and he punches him. Miz and Riley head for the hills and Del Rio attacks Rey on the floor. Some of the wrestlers come from the back to try to break up the situation in the ring between Edge and Kane. There is a mass of humanity trying to separate Kane and Edge and they appear to have things under control, but that doesn’t last long. Kane and Edge start punching people so they can fight some more. Kane with a choke slam to Trent Baretta but Edge with a spear to Kane as we go to credits.</p>

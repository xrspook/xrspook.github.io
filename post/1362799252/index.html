<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: DEL RIO VERSUS ZIGGLER; HENRY AND RYBACK CROSS PATHS AGAIN; FANDANGO INTERRUPTUS; CODY AND KAITLYN SITTING IN A TREE . . . DAMIEN SANDOW DOES NOT AGREE; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-03-08 21:59:47</p>
<p>We begin this week’s show with a graphic remembering Bill Moody who passed away earlier this week at age 58.</p>
<p>We take a look back at the end of last week’s Smackdown when Randy Orton and Sheamus fought back against the Shield and got some help from the Big Show. What happens tonight? Jack Swagger attacked three fellow Americans on Monday night. Dolph Ziggler gets his shot at the World Champion, but the title is not on the line. Will Ziggler cash in or will he waste another opportunity?</p>
<p>We are in Albany, New York and your announcers are Josh ‘Week Two of Good Announcing from Me’ Mathews and Michael ‘You Need Me On That Mic’ Cole.</p>
<p>Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter make their way to the ring. Jack welcomes everyone to Jack Swagger’s America. He says that he is your future World Champion. He wants everyone to show some respect to his friend and mentor. He is a Real American and a Founding Father. . . Zeb Colter.</p>
<p>Zeb wants to get down to it. He wants everyone to admit something to themselves. He wants them to admit that they share the same values as Jack and him. That they share the same sense of patriotism and think alike. They can all see what is wrong with our country, but you are too scared and afraid to say or do anything about it.</p>
<p>Zeb asks if they know anyone who has lost a job because someone has sneaked across our porous borders because they will work for a few pesos or a pat on the head. That is why they are your spokesman and they will be there to help with a new Bill of Rights for legal citizens.</p>
<p>Jack and Zeb give a We The People.</p>
<p>Zeb says that We the People have had enough.</p>
<p>Jack says that he will draw a line in the sand and he is taking America back.</p>
<p>Zeb says that if you don’t agree with them, then you are the problem because he and Jack are the solution.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio’s music plays and he comes out with Ricardo Rodriguez and el spit bucket.</p>
<p>Alberto tells Zeb and Jack that they have it all wrong. Alberto has a solution. He is going to show what Jack Swagger’s ‘Real America’ is all about.</p>
<p>We see a ‘video’ of ‘Jack and Zeb’ but Alberto is playing the part of Jack and Ricardo is playing the part of Zeb. ‘Zeb’ has to talk about Mexican Food and he says that it is a plot against America.</p>
<p>Alberto winks at Jack and Zeb as we go to commercial.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Three: Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) versus Dolph Ziggler (with AJ Lee and Big E Langston)</strong></p>
<p>They lock up and Ziggler with a punch but Del Rio with a kick to the leg. Ziggler punches Del Rio in the corner. Ziggler with an elbow to the back of the head followed by an Irish whip and a Stinger splash into the corner. Ziggler chokes Del Rio in the ropes and Langston’s fist gets in the way of Del Rio’s head as he walks by Del Rio.</p>
<p>Ricardo throws something at Langston and Langston is not impressed. Ricardo backs up and Langston is ready to destroy Ricardo but AJ tells Langston to stop. Ricardo takes the bucket and he wants to throw its contents at Langston but Big E moves and AJ gets hit with a bucket full of water.</p>
<p>Ricardo wants to apologize but Langston stops AJ. AJ gets into the ring and goes after Ricardo. Langston grabs AJ and the referee sends AJ and Langston to the back. Langston and AJ ask why Ricardo isn’t being sent to the back as we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Ziggler with an elbow drop and then he hits the delayed leaping elbow drop and gets a near fall. Ziggler with a reverse chin lock. Del Rio punches Ziggler and gets a near fall with a sunset flip. Ziggler with a drop kick and he gets a near fall.</p>
<p>We see Jack and Zeb in the back and Zeb gives Jack some advise about dealing with Alberto’s side kick.</p>
<p>Ziggler with a snap mare and body scissors. Ziggler with a reverse chin lock. Del Rio with a knee to the midsection followed by an Irish whip. Del Rio runs into an uppercut from Ziggler but Ziggler is sent into the air by Del Rio and he lands on his chest. Del Rio with a kick to the head and both men are down.</p>
<p>Ziggler misses the Stinger Splash and Del Rio with a forearm to the back and then he climbs the turnbuckles for more forearms and then Del Rio hits an inverted superplex and both men are down again. The referee makes his count but they get back to their feet. Alberto and Dolph exchange punches and kicks. Del Rio with two clotheslines and then he ducks a clothesline and when Ziggler comes off the ropes Del Rio hits a tilt-a-whirl back breaker.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a running super kick and he gets a near fall. Del Rio signals for the cross arm breaker but Ziggler with a kick. Del Rio with an Irish whip. Del Rio sends Ziggler into the ropes and he connects with a series of forearms to the kidneys. Ziggler gets to the apron but Del Rio puts him back in the ropes for a lungblower and Del Rio gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio goes to the turnbuckles and he is met with a drop kick from Ziggler and Dolph gets a near fall. Both men are down again and the count is started again. Ziggler misses a Fameasser and Del Rio with a German suplex for a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio sets for the step up enzuigiri in the corner but Ziggler meets him and hits a tornado DDT and Ziggler gets a near fall. Ziggler goes for the sleeper but Del Rio holds on to the ropes. Del Rio tries for the float over into the cross arm breaker but Ziggler counters with a rollup. Del Rio tries for a tilt-a-whirl move but Ziggler lands on his feet. Del Rio with the float over into the cross arm breaker and Ziggler taps out.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>

<p><strong>COMPLETE WWE NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS PPV COVERAGE</strong></p>
<p>By Mike Johnson on 2012-09-16 19:30:00</p>
<p>Welcome to PWInsider.com&rsquo;s live, ongoing coverage of WWE Night of Champions from Boston, MA!</p>
<p>Matt Striker and Scott Stanford are the pre-show hosts.</p>
<p>Backstage, Booker T was interviewed. He said he takes the prestige of the World title seriously but he also takes the safety of the wrestlers important, so right now, the Brogue Kick is banned.</p>
<p>Backstage, Alberto Del Rio and David Otunga were talking strategy when Ricardo showed up without his neck brace. He said his neck was feeling better and they reamed him out for not wearing the brace. Basically the idea was that Ricardo was being bullied into pretending he was hurt worse than he was.</p>
<p><strong>World champion Sheamus vs. Alberto Del Rio</strong></p>
<p>Booker T came out as they rang the bell. He said he had concluded his investigation and went over all the evidence. He went through countless hours of video footage. He said that the Brogue Kick was a devastating, dangerous move but when someone signs up to be a WWE star, there are risks involved. He announced the Kick was legal.</p>
<p>Del Rio argued to David Otunga, who ended up eating a Brogue Kick and was taken out.</p>
<p>Del Rio and Sheamus battled with Sheamus getting the better of the exchange. Del Rio nailed some headbutts but Sheamus came back with a neckbreaker. Del Rio nailed Sheamus with a series of kicks. He charged Sheamus, who moved and Del Rio took a crazy back first bump through the ropes to the floor. Sheamus came off the apron with a shoulderblock.</p>
<p>They battled back to the ring and into the corner. Del Rio jumped off the ropes, snapping Sheamus&rsquo; arm in the ringpost and then smashed him into the announcer&rsquo;s table. Del Rio covered Sheamus for a two count, then locked on an armbar to wear down the champion.</p>
<p>Sheamus tried to fire back but was kicked in the chest and then nailed with a knee to the back of the neck. Del Rio launched him shoulder-first into the ringpost and yanked at the arm, continuing to soften up the arm. Del Rio came off the ropes but was nailed by Sheamus.</p>
<p>Sheamus fought off Del Rio&rsquo;s attempts to go after the arm and nailed several hard shots for two counts. Del Rio charged Sheamus but was backdropped over the top to the apron. They battled on the apron and Del Rio was sent into the corner post. Sheamus beat him across the chest with hard shots.</p>
<p>Sheamus went for White Noise but Del Rio slipped through and nailed a Back Stabber for a two count. The crowd began chanting for Ziggler. Sheamus countered a rolling armbreaker attempt with White Noise and signaled for the Brogue Kick. Del Rio ducked the attempt and nailed a leaping enziguiri in the corner for a two count.</p>
<p>Del Rio drilled Sheamus with a kick. Sheamus missed the Brogue Kick. Del Rio went for the Rolling Armbar but Sheamus slipped out and went for the Texas Coverleaf. Sheamus charged Del Rio who ducked and Sheamus&rsquo; bad arm was caught in the ropes. Alberto kept working it over.</p>
<p>Sheamus tried to go for White Noise but he was hurt and Del Rio snapped his arm and locked on the rolling cross armbreaker in the middle of the ring. Sheamus powered out and slammed Del Rio down. He went for the Brogue Kick but Del Rio ducked and locked on the armbreaker. Sheamus teased tapping but made it to the ropes with his legs.</p>
<p>Del Rio began getting frustrated and screamed to himself. He missed a enziguiri in the corner. Sheamus nailed the Brogue Kick and got the pin.</p>
<p>Your winner and still World champion, Sheamus!</p>
<p>Solid match. They told a really good story with the arm being worked on and Sheamus having to come back from that and overcome the damage.</p>

<p>Posted by Scott Slimmer on 09.16.2012</p>
<p>We are LIVE in beautiful Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio, Ricardo Rodriguez, and David Otunga are scheming in the back. Ricardo takes his neck brace off because he&rsquo;s feeling much better, but Del Rio and Otunga berate him and tell him to NEVER take off his neck brace.</p>
<p>World Heavyweight Championship Match</p>
<p>Sheamus (Champion) vs. Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>Before the match begins, Booker T comes out to the stage and announces that he&rsquo;s concluded his investigation. Yes, the Brogue Kick is a dangerous maneuver, but that&rsquo;s part of being a WWE Superstar. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, Booker T declares that the Brogue Kick is reinstated and legal. Sucks for Del Rio. The match begins, and Del Rio pulls Otunga up onto the ring apron to bitch at him. Sheamus goes for the quick Brogue Kick, but Del Rio evades, causing Sheamus to Brogue Kick Del Rio off the ring apron. Sheamus heads up top, but Del Rio follows him up. Del Rio jumps down and bounces Sheamus off the ropes as he goes. Sheamus crumbles onto the ring steps, so Del Rio shoves him so that he slams into the Spanish announce table. Del Rio rolls Sheamus back into the ring and begins to work over the arm to set up the Cross Arm Breaker. JBL calls Mil Mascaras &ldquo;the most evil, maniacal, selfish human being that ever lived.&rdquo; Awesome. Del Rio heads up top and goes for a big splash, but Sheamus catches Del Rio with a mid-air punch to the gut. Sheamus whips Del Rio to the corner and charges toward him, but Del Rio catches Sheamus with a back elbow shot. Del Rio pulls Sheamus&rsquo; arm over the top rope and locks in a hanging version of the Cross Arm Breaker. Del Rio breaker the hold at four, head up top, and again goes for a big splash, but Sheamus once again counters, this time with a double ax-handle shot to the head. Sheamus hits the ropes and connects with a high knee and scoop slam for a two count. Sheamus stretches Del Rio across the top rope, but Del Rio tries to counter and whip Sheamus to the corner, but Sheamus counters and slams Del Rio into the ring post. Sheamus stretches Del Rio across the top turnbuckle in the corner and beats on his chest. Sheamus rolls Del Rio back into the ring and goes for White Noise, but Del Rio counters into the Backstabber for a two count. Del Rio sets up Sheamus for the Cross Arm Breaker, but Sheamus counters into White Noise. Sheamus sets up for the Brogue Kick, but Del Rio ducks and connects with a kick to the back of the head in the corner for a two count. Del Rio goes for the Cross Arm Breaker, but Sheamus counters and goes for the Brogue Kick, but Del Rio ducks and goes for the Cross Arm Breaker, but Sheamus counters and goes for the Texas Cloverleaf, but Del Rio kicks him away to prevent the hold. Sheamus charges Del Rio, but Del Rio low bridges the top rope, and Sheamus ends up with his left arm caught up in the top and middle ropes. Del Rio repeatedly kicks the arm while Sheamus is trapped, but eventually the referee forces the break. Sheamus rolls back into the ring, but Del Rio hits the Backstabber and locks in the Cross Arm Breaker right in the middle of the ring. Sheamus fights… and fights… and fights… and rolls over so that he can counter into a power bomb. There have been some great counters and reversals in this match. Sheamus sets up for the Brogue Kick, but Del Rio ducks and once again locks in the Cross Arm Breaker. Sheamus FINALLY gets his foot on the ropes to break the hold. Del Rio goes for the enzuigiri in the corner, but Sheamus evades and catches Del Rio with the Brogue Kick on the rebound for the three count.</p>
<p>Match Result: Sheamus defeats Alberto Del Rio with the Brogue Kick.</p>

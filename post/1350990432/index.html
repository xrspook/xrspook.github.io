<p><strong>TWO MAJOR TITLE CHANGES, HHH VS. PUNK AND MORE: COMPLETE WWE NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS PPV COVERAGE</strong></p>
<p>By Mike Johnson on 2011-09-18 10:50:00</p>
<p>The WWE title is next, so Punk vs. HHH are headlining Night of Champions when neither are a champion.</p>
<p><strong>WWE champion Alberto Del Rio vs. John Cena</strong></p>
<p>Del Rio came out walking, upset about his car not being there. John Cena then drove out in the car. Del Rio demanded that Ricardo announce him in Spanish to get heat, stopping Justin Roberts from making the official ring announcements. Cena then took the mic and stopped Roberts from making his ring announcement for Cena. Cena told Del Rio said that he hates the fact that Del Rio thinks he’s better than all these people and that he’s in a class of himself. He said that he doesn’t have his own garbage ring announcer but he’ll give it a try and introduced himself, saying he was a “fighting Fruity Pebble.” He let Roberts do his name after giving out a ton of nicknames.</p>
<p>Cena took over Del Rio with a headlock takedown. He was shoved off into the ropes but shoulderblocked Del Rio down. Tons of dueling chants. Del Rio took control with several kicks but wa shoulderblocked back down. Cena nailed a bulldog but was tripped by Ricardo. The referee tossed him out of the ringside area.</p>
<p>Cena unloaded on Del Rio but missed a charge in the corner. Del Rio kicked him hard in the back and ribs, then sent him to the floor. Alberto followed and shoved him backward into the announcing table. Del Rio tossed him back into the ring and ascended to the top rope, coming off with a shot and locked in a rear chinlock. Cena powerd out and slammed Del Rio over, covering him for a two count.</p>
<p>Cena whipped Del Rio into the corner, then nailed a Perfectplex for a two count. Del Rio snapped Cena’s arm and covered him but Cena made it to the ropes. Del Rio waited for Cena to return to his feet and kicked him in the face. Del Rio kicked him hard and covered him for a two count. Alberto worked over Cena and covered him for a two count.</p>
<p>They locked up and Cena used a sloppy looking belly to belly suplex but was too hurt to make the cover. The referee nearly counted both men down. They returned to their feet but nailed a double clothesline, taking each other out again. The referee began counting them both down but they made it to their feet. Del Rio started drilling Cena with several kicks. Cena ended up on the apron hanging off the ropes to save himself. Cena finally snapped his throat over the ropes, recovered and charged the ring, only to be cut off with another clothesline for a two count.</p>
<p>Del Rio charged Cena in the ropes but Cena moved and Del Rio took a sick backfirst bump to the outside through the ropes (think Chris Hamrick and Heavy Metal). Cena suplexed him back into the ring from the apron when Del Rio recovered enough to get back up. The ref started counting both down. Cena recovered first and nailed all his trademark offense to set up the Five Knuckle Shuffle.</p>
<p>Cena went for the Attitude Adjustment but Cena slipped out and nailed the enziguiri for a near fall. He set up Cena for the cross armbreaker but was shoved off. Cena hit a splash in the corner, then a dropkick for another two count. Cena seemed to be favoring his hip. He went to the top but was naiked with a springboard kick and fell into the ring. Del Rio covered him for another two count.</p>
<p>Del Rio went for a kick but was caught and Cena went for the STF. Del Rio took control and tied Cena up in the corner. He went for a diving charge at Cena but the challenger pulled himself up and Del Rio hit the post shoulderfirst hard. Cena was on the top rope and nailed the Alabama Jam onto the back of Del Rio’s neck but the champion kicked out at the last second.</p>
<p>Del Rio caught a surprised Cena with a bridging German suplex for another two count. Del Rio set up Cena near the corner and went to the top. His facial expressions were awesome. Del Rio hit a back senton splash for a two count. Of course, none of the announcers knew what the move was.</p>
<p>Del Rio caught Cena with the rolling cross-armbreaker. Cena was trying hard to break the leverage and powered the champion up, dropping him powerbomb style. Cena locked in the STF and Del Rio finally tapped.</p>
<p>Your winner and new WWE champion, John Cena!</p>
<p>Another good match. It started off a little rough but once Ricardo was tossed, they had a good back and forth dramatic match with Cena being in a lot more peril than usual. One has to question Del Rio losing the belt so quickly, but you don’t know what tomorrow will bring.</p>

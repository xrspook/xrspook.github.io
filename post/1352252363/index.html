<p><strong>Team Foley vs. Team Ziggler (Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Tag Team Match)</strong></p>
<p>BY John Clapp</p>
<p>November 05, 2012</p>
<p>Oh, how quickly things change. Just last week it looked like WWE Champion CM Punk would be captaining a squad of Superstars against Mick Foley’s hand-selected team in a Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Tag Team Match, and now The Second City Saint is gearing up for a title defense at WWE’s fall classic against both John Cena and former Team Foley member Ryback.</p>
<p>Thanks to the head-spinning turn of events facilitated by Raw Managing Supervisor Vickie Guerrero (with a gentle nudge from WWE Chairman Mr. McMahon) on the Nov. 5 edition of Raw, both teams have undergone radical transformations. Team Punk has replaced two members, starting at the top, and is now known as Team Ziggler, while Team Foley finds itself in need of a fifth member.</p>
<p>The alterations for the former Team Punk began when original team member The Miz criticized The Second City Saint’s leadership, or lack thereof, and informed Paul Heyman that he wanted no part of the WWE Champion’s unit.</p>
<p>Still thinking Punk would be a team captain come Nov. 18, Heyman aggressively sought out the services of Wade Barrett, who agreed to join in exchange for a yet-to-be-named favor from Heyman.</p>
<p>With his team seemingly at full capacity once more, Punk then had the ultimate rug pulled out from beneath him when Vickie announced that the WWE Championship will be defended at Survivor Series against both Ryback and Cena in a Triple Threat Match.</p>
<p>Sensing an urgent need to rebuild the Survivor Series teams, The Queen Diva subsequently moved Dolph Ziggler into position as the team’s new captain — a development that delighted The Showoff. Meanwhile, the rest of the former Team Punk — Alberto Del Rio and The Rhodes Scholars — remains intact, for now.</p>
<p>Not to be overlooked are the major implications that Vickie’s blockbuster WWE Title Match announcement has for Team Foley. Though much will be made of the new-look Team Ziggler, the fact that Ryback is now scheduled for his second WWE Title opportunity in as many months means The Hardcore Legend has a talent search on his hands. Who will Foley draft to fight alongside WWE Tag Team Champions Team Hell No, Intercontinental Champion Kofi Kingston and The Viper, Randy Orton?</p>

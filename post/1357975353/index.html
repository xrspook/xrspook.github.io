<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: THE ROCK RETURNS HOME; WHO WAS THE LAST MAN STANDING?; THE EYBROW VERSUS THE MUSTACHE?; MAYBE SHEAMUS WILL TAKE ON THE SPIRIT SQUAD NEXT; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-01-11 22:00:50</p>
<p>On Monday night, the Rock returned to the WWE to get ready for his match against CM Punk at the Royal Rumble. Tonight, Smackdown is in the Rock’s home town of Miami and he returns to his show. What will the Rock say to his fans . . . and how will CM Punk respond to the Rock Bottom from Raw? Will Alberto Del Rio achieve his destiny tonight against Big Show and become the World Champion?</p>
<p>We are in Miami, Florida and your announcers are John ‘I talk louder so the people can understand me better’ Layfield and Josh ‘Can someone tell my color commentator to Be A Star’ Mathews.</p>
<p>Booker T makes his way to the ring and he has something to say. He welcomes everyone to Smackdown. He says that he promises that he will kick off this year with a bang. He says that Raw was epic, but anything Raw can do . . . Smackdown can do better. He will not take a back seat to anyone.</p>
<p>Raw gave us Dolph Ziggler versus John Cena. Booker says that he will give us the United States Champion Antonio Cesaro against Randy Orton. Raw delivered ‘The Great One’. Booker says that he will do one better. After ten years, the most electrifying man in sports entertainment will be in this ring. To top things off, Big Show will defend the World Title against Alberto Del Rio in a Last Man Standing Match.</p>
<p>Big Show interrupts Booker and he makes his way to the ring. Show says every week it is something. He calls Booker’s decision ‘horrible’. Show gets a mic and he says that Booker is not fooling him with this crap. It is a personal vendetta that Booker has because he is still the World Champion while Booker pushes papers behind a desk.</p>
<p>He wants to know why Booker does not like him as the champion. He knows that Booker wants the fans in Miami to embrace Alberto Del Rio because of the Latino population in Miami. Show says that Del Rio is beneath him. You cannot give people like this a hero. There are no Latino heroes.</p>
<p>Show says that he is the World Champion. There is no Irish hero. There is no Latino Hero. There is no Viper hero that is going to stop him.</p>
<p>Show says that he sees what this is about. Booker wants to give these weak, feeble, inferior people a hero. He says that is a bad idea. He advises very strongly that Booker make the right decision and change his mind.</p>
<p>Show grabs Booker by the throat and Alberto’s music plays. Del Rio runs to the ring and he connects with a super kick followed by a drop kick and a step up enzuigiri. Del Rio with a drop kick that sends Show to the floor.</p>
<p>We are back and Matt Striker wants to talk to Alberto Del Rio in the locker room. Matt asks Alberto about what happened earlier in the night about the Last Man Standing Match. Alberto says that Big Show is the most insecure person because he bullies Ricardo and then he runs down his people.</p>
<p>Show knows nothing about the Latino people and he will learn about La Familia. The last man standing tonight will be Latino and he will be Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Five: Big Show versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) for the World Title in a Last Man Standing Match</strong></p>
<p>Del Rio with kicks to the leg but Show with a head butt. Show with a chop to the chest and Del Rio goes to his knees. Show with a forearm to the back and then he slams Del Rio. The referee starts his count and Del Rio gets up. Show says that it will be a long night Pedro. Del Rio with a savate kick but Show with a punch and chop. Show goes to the floor and he gets a table.</p>
<p>Show sets up the table on the floor and then he pulls Del Rio to the floor and head butts him. Show adjusts the table and then he slams Del Rio through the table. The referee counts but Del Rio gets up at six. Show with a head butt and Del Rio goes down again. Show takes a chair and he sends Del Rio back into the ring. Show gets back into the ring.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a kick to stop Show from using the chair. Del Rio hits Show in the back with the chair and then he hits Show in the ribs with the side of the chair and then he hits him in the back with another chair shot. Del Rio hits Show in the ribs again and then in the back one more time.</p>
<p>Del Rio yells out Destiny and he tries to float over into the cross arm breaker but Show picks up Del Rio. Del Rio holds on and applies the cross arm breaker while hanging from the ropes. Show picks up Del Rio and drops him on the apron.</p>
<p>Del Rio falls to the floor and the referee starts his count but Del Rio gets up at seven.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Del Rio kicks Show in the ribs and punches him. Del Rio works on the arm and sends the arm into the ring post. Show stops Del Rio and sends him back into the ring. Show gets another table from under the ring and he brings it into the ring.</p>
<p>Show sets up the table against the turnbuckles but Del Rio with a kick and punches. Del Rio with head butts and then he hits a drop kick that sends Show through the table in the corenr and the referee starts his count. Show gets up seven and the match continues.</p>
<p>Del Rio tries for a sleeper but Show fights off the hold. While it is not a sleeper, he is choking Show out. Show starts to lose his balance but Show gets a second wind and he takes Del Rio down with an arm wringer. Del Rio with a super kick followed by kicks and a series of clotheslines but Show stays on his feet. Show sends Del Rio into the corner and then he runs into boots from Del Rio.</p>
<p>Show grabs Del Rio as he comes off the turnbuckles and Show hits a choke slam. The referee starts his count but Del Rio gets up at nine. Show with a head butt that sends Del Rio through the ropes and to the floor. Show goes to the floor and he sets for a spear to Del Rio and he sends Del Rio through the ringside barrier. The referee starts his count on Del Rio and Alberto does not move until five but he gets up at nine. Del Rio collapses again but he keeps the match going. Show sends Del Rio back into the ring. Show returns to the ring as well. Show signals for the knock out punch and he connects. The referee starts his count but Del Rio is able to roll to the floor and he props himself up long enough to get the referee to stop the count.</p>
<p>Del Rio falls to the floor again and Ricardo tries to help revive Del Rio with some water. Show grabs the ring steps and he picks them up. Show tries to hit Del Rio with the steps against the ring post but Del Rio moves and the steps hit Show and he is having trouble keeping his balance.</p>
<p>Del Rio picks up the steps and he hits Show with them. Show stays on his feet. Del Rio picks up the steps again and he throws them at Show. Del Rio picks up the steps one more time and he throws them at Show and Show is down behind the announce table. Del Rio pushes the announce table onto Show. The referee makes his count and both men are down. Del Rio gets up at seven but Show does not get up.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>

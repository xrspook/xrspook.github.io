<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: ANTONIO CESARO MAKES HIS IN RING DEBUT . . . YES; TEDDY LONG IS BULLIED . . . YES; AJ STILL IN SHOCK . . . YES; PAY PER VIEW ON SUNDAY . . . YES</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-04-27 22:10:44</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Grand Rapids, Michigan and your announcers are Michael ‘Why am I scheduled to interview Brock next week’ Cole and Booker ‘I have to interview Brock this weekend’ T.</p>
<p>Michael reminds us that Josh Mathews is not with them tonight because of the injuries he suffered at the hands of Brock Lesnar on Monday night during Raw.</p>
<p>Daniel Bryan makes his way to the ring and YES, he has something to say this week.</p>
<p>Daniel has a smile on his face from ear to ear and he says that he did it. He cut the umbilical cord and finally got rid of AJ. He says that this feels so good. There is still something bothering him and he wants to set the record straight. That loss at Wrestlemania. That eighteen second loss to Sheamus at Wrestlemania . . . that does not count. If anything, that loss should go on AJ’s record, not his. That is because AJ lost that match, not him.</p>
<p>Yet, Sheamus runs around with Daniel’s championship as if he won something. It is unbelievable but he plans to rectify that situation this Sunday at Extreme Rules. Sheamus cannot legitimately defeat him once, let alone in two out of three falls.</p>
<p>Despite his personal feelings for the Great White, when John Laurinaitis asked him to be the special referee for the match between Sheamus and Mark Henry on Monday, he promised to call it right down the middle.</p>
<p>Daniel says that he promised himself that he would call it right down the middle and he did. There are some people who have accused him of quick counting Sheamus’ shoulders to the mat. However, the footage speaks for itself.</p>
<p>We see the footage from Raw and the count looked slowed down a bit.</p>
<p>Daniel likes the footage we just saw. He says that there is absolutely nothing wrong with that count. In typical Sheamus fashion, he lost his cool. Daniel says that he was forced to defend himself.</p>
<p>We see footage of Sheamus bringing Daniel back into the ring only to fall victim to the LeBell Lock.</p>
<p>Daniel wants the footage paused to show Sheamus being stretched and about to tap out.</p>
<p>Now it is Question and Answer time with Daniel Bryan. Did Mark Henry beat Sheamus on Monday . . . Yes. Did Daniel Bryan make Sheamus tap out to the entire WWE Universe . . . Yes! Is Sheamus’ entire world title run a fluke because he took advantage of a confused and not very intelligent woman . . . YES. Will Daniel Bryan regain his World Championship at Extreme Rules . . . YES! YES! YES!</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio comes out to the ring after driving into the arena. Ricardo Rodriguez introduces Alberto and Alberto makes his way to the ring to talk to Daniel.</p>
<p>Alberto asks if Daniel Bryan has been making excuses since losing the World Title at Wrestlemania in 18 seconds . . . Si. Is the winner of the Daniel Bryan/Sheamus match going to eventually lose to the new number one contender Alberto Del Rio . . . SI. Will Daniel Bryan be forgotten when Alberto Del Rio becomes the next World Heavyweight Champion . . . SI SI SI SI</p>
<p>Alberto asks everyone if they are seeing the next World Heavyweight Champion . . .</p>
<p>We will never know because Big Show makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Show wants to know if it is ‘yes’ or ‘si’. Show goes back and forth and then he teaches taking a swing at Bryan but Daniel leaves the ring. Show grabs Ricardo before he can escape the ring. Show tells Ricardo to calm down. Show asks Ricardo if it is ‘yes’ or ‘si’. Ricardo simply groans. Show tells Ricardo ‘si’ and then choke slams Ricardo.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>Match Number One: Big Show versus Alberto Del Rio with the remnants of Ricardo Rodriguez</p>
<p>The match is joined in progress and Show with a chop followed by an Irish whip but Del Rio gets his knees up. Show with a forearm but Del Rio escapes a slam. Del Rio with a kick but Show with a shoulder tackle that sends Del Rio to the floor.</p>
<p>Show pulls Del Rio up to the apron but Del Rio drops Show’s arm on the rope. Del Rio with kicks to the arm and then he hits an arm breaker. Del Rio sets fro the float over but Del Rio remembers that it is Big Show and Show picks up Del Rio and hits a one armed belly-to-back suplex.</p>
<p>Show with a clothesline or two and then he Irish whips Del Rio into the corner and hits the running butt splash followed by a spear. Show signals for the choke slam but Cody Rhodes comes to the ring and he clips Show.</p>
<p>The referee calls for the bell.</p>
<p>Winner: Big Show by disqualification</p>
<p>After the match, Del Rio with a step up enzuigiri. Rhodes gets a kendo stick and a chair. Rhodes waits for Show to get up and he hits Show in the head with the kendo stick but Show gets up. Rhodes tries to use the chair but Show punches it. Rhodes tries to use his belt but Show with a kick and then Show goes after Cody’s shirt. Show whips Cody in the back and Cody leaves the ring and goes up the ramp.</p>

<p><strong>411&rsquo;s WWE SmackDown Report 4.27.12</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Colin Rinehart on 04.27.2012</p>
<p>Randy Orton was interviewed by Michael Cole, Sheamus took on Mark Henry, Antonio Cesaro made his in-ring debut and more! Check out 411&rsquo;s full WWE Smackdown report for all the details!</p>
<p>WWE Friday Night SmackDown<br>
April 27th, 2012<br>
Van Andel Arena, Grand Rapids, Michigan<br>
Attendance: Unknown at this time</p>
<p>Welcome back everyone to another edition of 411&rsquo;s WWE SmackDown report. We&rsquo;re only 48 hours away from the big Extreme Rules PPV featuring the in-ring wrestling return of Brock Lesnar against John Cena, so this should be your standard go-home show, probably loaded with more of the same Lesnar/Cena video packages we&rsquo;ve seen the last few weeks to try and give one last hard sell for the PPV. Onto the show!</p>
<p>Your hosts are Michael Cole and Booker T</p>
<p>We open the show with Sheamus vs. Mark Henry announced for later tonight before Cole and Booker inform us that Josh Matthews isn&rsquo;t here tonight because he&rsquo;s still recovering from the attack by Brock Lesnar on RAW this past week.</p>
<p>Daniel Bryan makes his way out next to formally kick off the show with a promo. He&rsquo;s practically gleeful because he&rsquo;s finally cut all ties to AJ and then proceeds to again blame the Wrestlemania loss on her, saying the loss should count on her record, not his. He talks about his role as special guest referee for the Sheamus/Mark Henry match on RAW this past week and he claims to have called it right down the middle as we see footage of his fast count on Sheamus in slow-motion so as to make it look legit. He gloats about putting Sheamus in the YES! Lock, claiming he made him tap before calling his whole title run a fluke. He promises to win the title at Extreme Rules when he&rsquo;s interrupted by the still utterly heatless Alberto Del Rio (not that it&rsquo;s his fault really considering how badly he was booked after winning the Rumble last year). Del Rio and Ricardo mock Bryan with their own SI! chant as Alberto promises to beat the winner of Bryan/Sheamus for the title. And now here comes Big Show to interrupt Del Rio. Have I mentioned how lazy these cookie cutter Smackdown opening segments are every week? Same exact formula every single time. Show leads the crowd in dueling &ldquo;YES!&rdquo; and &ldquo;SI!&rdquo; chants briefly before making a move on the heels, who take off immediately leaving Ricardo in the ring to eat a chokeslam. Well that segment basically guarantees us a Sheamus win on Sunday.</p>
<p>Big Show (22-6) vs. Alberto Del Rio (11-8)<br>
When we return from the break we&rsquo;ve joined our opening match in progress, a rematch from last week. Show overpowers Del Rio easily, sending him out to the floor early. Del Rio hangs Show over the top rope and then goes right to the armwork back in the ring. He tries for the cross-armbar but Show powers out easily and then hits the spear. He signals for the chokeslam, but Cody Rhodes hits the ring to give him a chop block, giving Show the DQ win for the second week in a row at 1:54. Cody and Del Rio beat down Show for a bit and then Cody tries to attack Show with a chair and a cane, but Show just yanks off Cody&rsquo;s belt and whips him senseless with it until he runs off. This wasn&rsquo;t half bad while it lasted but you knew where this was going as soon as the bell rung because you know neither of these guys are going to eat a clean pinfall here. *1/4</p>

<p><strong>411&rsquo;s Instant Analysis 04.27.12: WWE SmackDown</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Michael Ornelas on 04.27.2012</p>
<p>As we head toward Extreme Rules, Sheamus and Daniel Bryan posture for the advantage in their 2 out of 3 falls match, John Laurinaitis puts People Power into full effect, and Antonio Cesaro makes his WWE debut.</p>
<p>Welcome to the SmackDown Instant Analysis! I&rsquo;m your reviewer, Michael Ornelas, and before we kick this off, please check out the BRAND NEW EPISODE of my web series/local TV show &ldquo;Shenanigans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alright, now that you&rsquo;ve seen that, here are my policies for this column:<br>
-I do not watch or rate recaps or video packages (unless it&rsquo;s an impending debut or return).<br>
-My ratings reflect full segments and are not indicative of star ratings for matches.<br>
-I tend to watch with a positive outlook.<br>
-There will be no TNA bashing here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on the same page now, so let&rsquo;s get to tonight&rsquo;s WWE SmackDown!</p>
<p>SEGMENT ONE: Question &amp; Answer Time with Daniel Bryan</p>
<p>Bryan was in great true heel form tonight, calling out the champion, referring to AJ as stupid, and showing his excellent refereeing from Monday night…and he still got the crowd to chant &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; along with him. Then Alberto Del Rio came out with Ricardo Rodriguez and we got some always fun &ldquo;sí!&rdquo; chants. Big Show got to shine too as he choke-slammed Ricardo in a fun, harmless opening segment that built the World Heavyweight Championship match at Extreme Rules as well as the main event title scene in general.</p>
<p>Rating: 8.0 out of 10</p>
<p>SEGMENT TWO: The Big Show vs. Alberto Del Rio/Cody Aftermath<br>
Match Result: The Big Show beat Alberto Del Rio by disqualification<br>
Match Length: Two minutes shown</p>
<p>I really enjoy Del Rio and Show as opponents because Show&rsquo;s major moves are the Chokeslam and the KO Punch, while Alberto&rsquo;s specialty is working the arm. Unfortunately, Rhodes vs. Show is the WWE&rsquo;s priority in this segment, so we got less than two minutes for the match. The post-match made up for it though, as it previewed Extreme Rules for us with the appearance of a kendo stick, steel chair, and Cody&rsquo;s leather belt. It also showed that Cody may be in over his head this Sunday.</p>
<p>Rating: 6.0 out of 10</p>

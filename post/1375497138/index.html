<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-08-02 22:00:19</p>
<p>We are in Houston, Texas and your announcers are Alex ‘Life of’ Riley and Michael ‘JBL isn’t the only one at the Summit’ Cole.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio is in the ring and he is about to announce the person he will face for the World Title at SummerSlam. Alberto says that he wants to start off by saying thank you . . . thank you for nothing. When he was champion before, the people did not support him. They did not want him to be their champion.</p>
<p>Alberto says that there is nothing that the people can do about him being champion. Alberto thanks one person. The person with vision and leadership. That person is Vickie Guerrero. John Cena was allowed to choose his opponent for SummerSlam and Vickie has allowed him to do the same thing. He wants everyone to cheer for Vickie.</p>
<p>John Cena wasted his pick by choosing that little troll Daniel Bryan. We all know that John Cena only did that because he is afraid of Alberto Del Rio. That is when Alberto started thinking. Why don’t you choose, the Beast . . . Brock Lesnar? It turns out that Lesnar has different plans for SummerSlam so that is his lost.</p>
<p>Why not go loco and give a shot to Houston’s own . . . Booker T? Alberto remembered that Booker, just like everything else to come out of Houston is a big disappointment. The person he chose deserved this opportunity more than anyone. He is one of the greatest athletes of all time. He is big, fast, strong, and vicious. He is the perfect opponent for Alberto Del Rio. That is why he is going to give this person his first opportunity to be World Champion.</p>
<p>Alberto announces that his opponent is . . .</p>
<p>Ricardo Rodriguez</p>
<p>Vickie Guerrero comes out and she throws a few excuse mes Alberto’s way.</p>
<p>Alberto wants to hug Vickie but Vickie only has excuse mes for Alberto. She says that it seems like Alberto is trying to disrespect her. Vickie says that Daniel Bryan is a worthy competitor for the WWE Title. Instead, Alberto chooses Ricardo. He is a jiggly little manchild. He expected so much more from Alberto.</p>
<p>Alberto tells Vickie not to be mad at her. He says that he can pick someone else to be his opponent for SummerSlam. Alberto picks . . .</p>
<p>The Brooklyn Brawler.</p>
<p>Vickie tells Alberto to listen to her. The man who appointed her general manager would not like that decision either. Since she knew that Alberto would make an immature decision, at SummerSlam, Alberto will face the winner of the match between Rob Van Dam, Christian, and Randy Orton.</p>
<p>Vickie tells Alberto that she wasn’t born yesterday.</p>
<p>Alberto tells Vickie that she went back on her word because she said that he could pick whoever he wanted.</p>
<p>Vickie asks Alberto if he is afraid of competition.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he is not afraid of anyone. He says this is not the way you treat a champion.</p>
<p>Brad Maddox enters and Vickie yells at him. Brad says that he agrees with Vickie’s decision.</p>
<p>Alberto breathes heavily and then he leaves.</p>
<p>Before we find out who will face Alberto Del Rio at SummerSlam, Alberto makes his way to the ring and he calls them the Three Stooges. Alberto says that he will be watching and enjoying seeing them beating the guacamole out of each other. He says that Ricardo could have beaten any of them. At SummerSlam one of them will be tapping out to the World Champion.</p>

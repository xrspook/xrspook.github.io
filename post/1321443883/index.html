<p>4, 2010-09-10, 15, Defeating Matt Hardy on SmackDown, this new Superstar continued to impress. He&rsquo;ll get even more attention if he can get the better of Christian in their rivalry.</p>
<p>5, 2010-09-17, 14, SmackDown&rsquo;s hottest new Superstar continued to stir up trouble with Christian. Expect big things when these two talented competitors finally lock up.</p>
<p>6, 2010-09-24, 11, WWE&rsquo;s most talked about newcomer continued to shake things up on Friday night, battering Christian in two brutal attacks. Will he have the same effect on Rey Mysterio when they meet next week?</p>

<p>9, 2010-10-15, 9, With a win over Chris Masters, Alberto Del Rio earned a spot at WWE Bragging Rights, but will the aristocrat&rsquo;s teammates be able to trust him?</p>
<p>10, 2010-10-22, 7, With a victory over the explosive John Morrison on Friday night, Alberto Del Rio proved himself to be a valuable member of Team SmackDown.</p>

<p>17, 2010-12-10, 7, Although the aristocrat was pinned by Rey Mysterio on SmackDown, he did score a victory alongside his WWE NXT Rookie Conor O&rsquo;Brian on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>18, 2010-12-17, 4, The aristocrat continued to be a serious thorn in Rey Mysterio&rsquo;s side, but this week he was even more effective than normal. But will he be as effective in Sunday&rsquo;s Fatal Four-Way TLC Match?</p>
<p>19, 2010-12-24, 7, After being pushed off a ladder through a table at WWE TLC, the aristocrat is probably still pulling splinters out of his backside.</p>
<p>20, 2010-12-31, 9, The aristocrat must be tired of tasting Rey Mysterio&rsquo;s boots after getting blasted with another 619 on SmackDown.</p>

<p>37, 2011-04-30, 8, The Mexican Aristocrat was drafted to Raw this week, but before he goes to the red brand he&rsquo;ll challenge Christian for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship in a Ladder Match at Extreme Rules.</p>
<p>38, 2011-05-07, 11, On Sunday night, Alberto Del Rio once again came up short in his quest to win the World Heavyweight Championship. Now a member of Raw, he seems to have shifted his focus back to Rey Mysterio.</p>

<p>40, 2011-05-21, 15, If it wasn&rsquo;t for some last-minute interference from Ricardo Rodriguez, Alberto Del Rio may have gotten his perfect smile rearranged by Rey Mysterio&rsquo;s 619 on Monday night.</p>
<p>41, 2011-05-28, 15, The snide Mexican Superstar made a very dangerous enemy in Big Show this week when his personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez, drove a car over the giant&rsquo;s leg.</p>

<p>46, 2011-07-02, 14, Thanks to Mark Henry&rsquo;s brutal attack on Big Show, Alberto Del Rio was able to escape the steel cage and defeat Big Show on Monday night. Will he be as lucky in the Raw Money in the Bank Ladder Match on July 17?</p>

<p>51, 2011-08-06, 6, Showing his aggressive side, Alberto Del Rio attempted to snap Evan Bourne&rsquo;s arm on Raw before Kofi Kingston intervened to save his friend.</p>
<p>52, 2011-08-13, 7, Despite being pinned on Raw by WWE Champion CM Punk, Alberto Del Rio scored a key victory on SmackDown when he made the blue brand&rsquo;s resident submission specialist, Daniel Bryan, tap out to his cross armbreaker.</p>

<p>55, 2011-09-03, 4, The WWE Champion was absent from both Raw and SuperSmackDown this week, so John Cena had to take out his frustrations on Alberto Del Rio&rsquo;s personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez.</p>
<p>56, 2011-09-10, 6, Not only did the WWE Champion recruit Superstars to attack John Cena on Raw, but he attempted to ambush The Cenation Commander-in-Chief himself and ended up getting smashed by Cena.</p>
<p>57, 2011-09-17, 7, He might be the WWE Champion, but Alberto Del Rio&rsquo;s cowardice on WWE Raw SuperShow moves him move down the Power 25 rankings. Facing John Cena and Bret Hart, The Mexican Aristocrat left his personal ring announcer and tag partner, Ricardo Rodriguez, to fend for himself.</p>
<p>58, 2011-09-24, 8, Only a few weeks after realizing his destiny of becoming WWE Champion, Alberto Del Rio lost the title to John Cena at Night of Champions. The Mexican Aristocrat will have a chance to regain the title at WWE Hell in a Cell.</p>

<p>60, 2011-10-08, 1, With a little help from his personal ring announcer Ricardo Rodriguez (and a steel pipe), Alberto Del Rio controversially captured his second WWE Championship inside the dreaded Hell in a Cell. Once again, Del Rio took the top spot in the P25 rankings.</p>
<p>61, 2011-10-15, 1, The WWE Champion once again showed his cowardice during his tag bout with CM Punk against The Miz &amp; R-Truth on Monday night, but he did defeat Sheamus on SmackDown.</p>
<p>62, 2011-10-22, 5, At Vengeance, Alberto Del Rio will defend his WWE Title against John Cena in a bout the West Newbury, Mass., native has never lost — a Last Man Standing Match. Should The Mexican Aristocrat say &ldquo;adios&rdquo; to his championship?</p>
<p>63, 2011-10-29, 3, The Mexican Aristocrat had more than little help from Ricardo Rodriguez and The &ldquo;Awesome Truth&rdquo; on Sunday night, but he still successfully defended his WWE Title against John Cena in a Last Man Standing Match at Vengeance.</p>

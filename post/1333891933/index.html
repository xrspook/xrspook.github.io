<p><strong>WWE Smackdown Results: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</strong></p>
<p>By Justin Watry (Senior Writer) on April 6, 2012</p>
<p>WWE Smackdown was a highly enjoyable show Friday night. Raw was a top-notch show, and the Blue Brand came through as well. If I had to grade the program, I&rsquo;d fall in the B range.</p>
<p>The Good</p>
<p>The main event between Sheamus and Alberto Del Rio was pretty good. It wasn&rsquo;t anything amazing, but it did its job. It gave Del Rio a screwy victory in his return, yet kept the new World Champion strong moving forward.</p>
<p>It seems like Bryan, Sheamus and Del Rio may be headed for a triple threat title match. That would be okay in my book.</p>

<p><strong>411&rsquo;s WWE SmackDown Report 4.6.12</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Colin Rinehart on 04.06.2012</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio faced Sheamus for a shot at the World title, Randy Orton faced Kane in a Wrestlemania rematch, Daniel Bryan spoke about his Wrestlemania loss and more! Check out 411&rsquo;s full WWE Smackdown report for all the details!</p>
<p>WWE Friday Night Smackdown<br>
April 6th, 2012<br>
Amway Center, Orlando, Florida<br>
Attendance: Unknown at this time</p>
<p>Well we&rsquo;re only a few days removed from another memorable Wrestlemania and the return of none other than one Brock Lesnar the following night on RAW, and now we&rsquo;ve arrived to the first Smackdown in the new John Laurinatitis as GM era. We&rsquo;re just a stone&rsquo;s throw away from Miami in Orlando tonight, and we&rsquo;ve got a big match already announced for tonight with a returning Alberto Del Rio taking on our newly crowned World Heavyweight champion Sheamus in a non title match in our main event, and if Del Rio wins he gets a title shot down the line. We&rsquo;ve also got Kane and Randy Orton in a Wrestlemania rematch, with No DQ, and that should be solid. Enough preambling, let&rsquo;s jump into the show itself.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio (10-7) vs. Sheamus (27-14-1)<br>
This is Del Rio&rsquo;s in-ring return after several months off due to injury and it&rsquo;s a non-title match with the stipulation that if he wins, he gets a title shot at Sheamus down the line. Sheamus tries working some basic holds with the chin and wrist, but Del Rio counters with stiff kicks. Sheamus rolls through off a top rope attempt and then gives Del Rio the old Finlay Roll for a two count. Del Rio catches Sheamus with a ringer over the top rope and then goes right to work on the Celtic Warrior&rsquo;s arm. Del Rio looks to go for the cross armbar and Sheamus counters into an attempt at the Brogue Kick, but Del Rio avoids the boot and bails out of the ring for a breather with Ricardo as take our last commercial break. When we return Del Rio is being hit by a slingshot shoulder-block from Sheamus for a two count. Sheamus lays in ten big forearms on Del Rio in the top rope but Del Rio low-bridges him moments later and then follows up with a nice step-up enziguri to send the Irishman back outside to the floor. Del Rio continues the arm work on Sheamus, slamming him into the steel ring steps and then returning to a tight armbar back inside the ring. Sheamus manages to break the hold up and hit Del Rio with the Irish Curse backbreaker. Sheamus fires up with some stiff forearms and hits a running powerslam on Alberto before calling for the Brogue Kick. Ricardo hops in the ring now to run the distraction while Del Rio grabs a steel chair, but Sheamus takes Ricardo out. Unfortunately when the ref turns around he only sees Sheamus grabbing the steel chair from Del Rio, who channels the spirit of the late great Eddie Guerrero by pretending Sheamus has just hit him with the chair, and the ploy actually works as the ref DQs Sheamus at 7:38 (shown). So Del Rio gets a title shot because of that, and Sheamus gives the referee a Brogue Kick for being so inept. The match itself was pretty darn good for the time it got though and I honestly wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing these two wrestle a title match down the line, though they should absolutely make sure not to forget Daniel Bryan in the fold. Haven&rsquo;t seen that finish in a while either, we&rsquo;ll see if they acknowledge that being Eddie&rsquo;s famous old trick or not next week. **1/2</p>
<p>We go off the air with Del Rio and Ricardo celebrating on the entrance ramp while Sheamus seethes in the ring.</p>

<p><strong>411&rsquo;s Instant Analysis 04.06.12: WWE SmackDown</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Michael Ornelas on 04.06.2012</p>
<p>Randy Orton and Kane tear it up with a No DQ match, Alberto Del Rio returns to the ring, Daniel Bryan deals with AJ&rsquo;s distraction from WrestleMania 28, and People Power begins!</p>
<p>SEGMENT TEN: Sheamus vs. Alberto Del Rio<br>
Match Result: Alberto Del Rio beat Sheamus by disqualification<br>
Match Length: Seven and a half minutes</p>
<p>This was a fun tease as to what these two men could do together in a match, and Alberto looked good in his return. I think the Eddie Guerrero finish was good in concept, but the execution I thought was a little sloppy. The timing was off and I feel Del Rio should have been selling the fake chair shot earlier, but that&rsquo;s a minor nitpick. This was a strong way to close the show and I just hope this feud doesn&rsquo;t eclipse Bryan&rsquo;s rematch (even though it&rsquo;d be a good match, I don&rsquo;t really want to see a triple threat at Extreme Rules from a story standpoint). Also, who doesn&rsquo;t love Ricardo Rodriguez?! ALBERTO DEL RIO! ALBERTO DEL RIO! ALBERTO DEL RIO! That&rsquo;s the most excited I&rsquo;ve seen someone about a win since the inception of the &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; chant.</p>
<p>Rating: 7.0 out of 10</p>

<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: DANIEL BRYAN SPEAKS; RYBACK RETURNS; THE FALLOUT OF SUPPORTING TEDDY LONG; LIVE SMACKDOWN NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-04-06 22:28:40</p>
<p>We are back and it is time to look at photos of the World Title Match, and you have probably seen the whole match again in case you missed it on Sunday.</p>
<p>We take a look back at Monday night when Alberto Del Rio interrupted Sheamus’ promo on Monday.</p>
<p>Johnny tells Sheamus that it is a new day and era on Smackdown. Sheamus asks Johnny what People Power means. Johnny says that it means using sportsmanship and professionalism. Johnny says that he will have Alberto and Sheamus face to face before the match starts.</p>
<p>Sheamus says that he will only do it to people who really deserve it. Whether it be a cowardly weasel who hides behind his girlfriend, or an arrogant rich boy who thinks he is better than everyone else. Sheamus then talks about a relative of his who had his head shoved up his arse.</p>
<p>Match Number Six: Alberto Del Rio with Ricardo Rodriguez versus Sheamus in a Non Title Match</p>
<p>They lock up and Sheamus with a hip lock take down into a side head lock. Sheamus with a shoulder tackle or two and he gets a near fall. Sheamus works on the arm but Del Rio with kicks to Sheamus. Sheamus with a kick but Del Rio with forearms. Del Rio runs into boots from Sheamus.</p>
<p>Sheamus goes up top and he goes over Del Rio. Sheamus gets Del Rio on his shoulder and hits a fireman’s carry slam and gets a near fall. Sheamus with knees to the back and the referee warns him. Del Rio drops Sheamus’ arm on the ropes and then he kicks Sheamus in the arm. Del Rio with an arm bar.</p>
<p>Del Rio with forearms to Sheamus but Sheamus with punches. Del Rio tries for the float over into the cross arm breaker but Sheamus avoids it. Del Rio avoids a Brogue Kick as he goes to the floor and we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Sheamus with the slingshot sholder tackle for a near fall. Sheamus kicks Del Rio and then he puts Alberto in the ropes and connects with the forearms across the chest. Sheamus with a front face lock and then he charges at Del Rio but Del Rio ducks down and Sheamus goes to the floor.</p>
<p>Sheamus gets back to the apron and Del Rio with a enzuigiri that sends Sheamus to the floor. Del Rio sends Sheamus’ arm into the ring steps. Del Rio then sends Sheamus shoulder first into the ring steps to set up the cross arm breaker.</p>
<p>They return to the ring and Del Rio with a near fall. Del Rio with a key lock on Sheamus. Sheamus with a kick but he takes too long on a neck breaker and Del Rio with kicks and a drop kick. Del Rio returns to the arm bar. Del Rio with a head butt and kick but Sheamus with the uranage back breaker and both men are down.</p>
<p>Sheamus with running double sledges to Del Rio’s head followed by a clothesline and forearms in the corner. Sheamus with a running power slam and then he signals that it is over, but Ricardo gets on the apron to distract Sheamus. Sheamus kicks the ropes to get Ricardo into the ring. Del Rio has a chair and Sheamus attacks Del Rio behind the referee’s back. The referee sees Sheamus with the chair and he disqualifies him.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>After the match, Sheamus with a Brogue Kick to the referee.</p>

<p><strong>The Doctor&rsquo;s WWE SmackDown Recap: The 122 Things We Learned, Loved and Hated</strong></p>
<p>By Chris Mueller AKA The Doctor (Featured Columnist) on April 7, 2012</p>
<p>96. The Bellas are shown with Johnny Ace backstage when Sheamus walks in.<br>
97. JL talks about how Sheamus is giving people cheap shots lately.<br>
98. He&rsquo;s not wrong.<br>
99. Sheamus promises to only start kicking the people who really deserve it.<br>
108. Alberto Del Rio is out next for his match before we go to commercial.<br>
109. Both men get in some decent offense before Del Rio starts working over Sheamus&rsquo; arm.<br>
110. Del Rio looks pretty good for this being his first match back after an injury.<br>
111. Both men almost hit their finishers right before a commercial airs.<br>
112. After the commercial, Sheamus is in control.<br>
113. The crowd can count to 10 faster than the ref can count to five.<br>
114. Del Rio always hits a great Enzuigiri kick.<br>
115. Del Rio comes back with some nice moves which put some damage on Sheamus&rsquo; arm.<br>
116. I wonder if 100 years from now things will be so digital that there will be a HUD on real wrestling shows and not just video games.<br>
117. Sheamus gets DQ&rsquo;d after being caught with a chair Del Rio was going to use.<br>
118. This reminds me of when Eddie Guerrero used to set people up to get disqualified by hitting the ground with a chair, tossing it to the opponent and then lay down before the ref turned around.<br>
119. Sheamus give the ref a Brogue Kick after the ref takes the chair away from him.<br>
120. Booker says he will probably get fined, which I think they claim he did.<br>
121. The show ends with Alberto celebrating a cheap win.</p>

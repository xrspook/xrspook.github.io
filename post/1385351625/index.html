<p><strong>COMPLETE WWE SURVIVOR SERIES BLOG, OR&hellip;DANIEL BRYAN IS SORELY MISSED IN THE MAIN EVENT PICTURE</strong></p>
<p>By Mike Johnson on 2013-11-24 19:36:46</p>
<p>Welcome to my Survivor Series 2013 blog, looking at the PPV as it&rsquo;s ongoing. Since Dave Scherer is flying today, I&rsquo;m handling blogging duties while Richard Trionfo will handle play by play.</p>
<p>They did a great video showcasing John Cena&rsquo;s insane ahead of schedule return to the ring, followed by a vignette where the trainer was checking on John Cena&rsquo;s elbow. He said it was structurally solid but there was some selling. Cena wanted to wrestle without the protective sleeve. Well, we now know the story of the match will be based at least partially on Alberto going for the cross armbreaker on the weakened arm.</p>
<p>Even in his hometown, Cena is gettng the dueling chants. It was all Alberto early on. Cena kept trying to make a comeback but ADR would take him out and work on his bad arm. There was a fun sequence where Cena went for the Five Knuckle Shuffle but ADR kicked him in the face and then DDT&rsquo;d him. Cena made a comeback but ADR was all over him. That was pretty much the story of the match with ADR working him over and Cena pulling out a big move only to be taken down again. They did the exact same Superman Cena powerbomb out of the armbar again. Out of nowhere, Cena caught him with the AA and pinned Del Rio. Felt like a house show match at the end of a program where there was no real drama or anticipation going in, so the match was flat, which is what this was.</p>

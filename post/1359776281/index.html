<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: WHAT IS NEXT FOR ALBERTO DEL RIO AND BIG SHOW; ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCH TEASED; AN ALL AMERICAN AMERICAN RETURN; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-02-01 21:59:35</p>
<p>We know that John Cena does not want anything to do with the World Heavyweight Title because he knows that he would win it easily. Who will be the man to challenge Alberto Del Rio for the World Title, if he is still the champion on April 7th? How will the end of Raw impact this week’s Smackdown? What will happen in the main event of this show? Will the ring be full of honor? What is next for these superstars?</p>
<p>This week’s show is in San Diego, California and your announcers are John ‘We Scream on Friday Night’ Layfield and Josh ‘Yeah, I know, you wish that wrestler would do that to me and that you want a one man booth’ Mathews.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio is waiting outside the building for Big Show to arrive at the arena.</p>
<p>We go inside the arena and we have some people inside the ring. Booker T and Teddy Long are joined by Sheamus, Randy Orton, Great Khali, Daniel Bryan, and Kane. Dolph Ziggler, AJ Lee, and Big E Langston are on the floor. Booker welcomes everyone to Smackdown. Booker reminds us that John Cena won the Royal Rumble and John has announced his opponent for Wrestlemania.</p>
<p>That means that someone has to face the World Champion. The five men in the ring have their unique qualities and he says that everyone has been a World Champion before. One of these men will have the chance to be World Champion one more time. All you have to do is win the Elimination Chamber match. There are only six spots in the match . . .</p>
<p>From out of nowhere, Jack Swagger’s music plays and he comes out and he has grown a beard. He says that Booker forgot someone. He left someone out of this gathering of World Champions.</p>
<p>Booker wants to know where Jack has been.</p>
<p>Jack says that he has been living the life of a real American and his eyes have been opened. He has been watching everything and he is very disappointed in the way that WWE is heading. He tells Booker that he wants to be put into the Elimination Chamber match and he’ll do the rest.</p>
<p>Booker tells Jack that he has to earn his spot in the match.</p>
<p>Dolph interrupts Booker’s counting of the contenders and he tells him that he has had enough. He says that he is already Mr. Money in the Bank and he has a guaranteed World Title Match. Dolph says that Booker is suggesting that they participate in the most barbaric match in the WWE, or he can just sit back, do nothing and still have his guaranteed Title match. Dolph says that he will win the World Title, especially if the champ is Alberto Del Rio. He can cash in the briefcase anywhere he wants . . . even Wrestlemania. Dolph tells AJ and Langston that they are out of here.</p>
<p>While Dolph leaves, Booker tells Teddy that Dolph was going to chicken out of the Elimination Chamber match. Booker says that Dolph can chicken out of the chamber but he won’t be able to chicken out of the match tonight against Alberto.</p>
<p>Booker says that they will be in matches tonight. All they have to do is impress him and Teddy and they will decide. It is time to kick things off with a bang.</p>
<p>Daniel Bryan and Kane will face Sin Cara and a former World Champion and San Diego’s own Rey Mysterio.</p>
<p>We are back and Alberto Del Rio is still outside the ring where we pace around the parking lot on Friday nights.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio is outside and security is trying to tell Alberto to put the pipe down. Alberto speaks in Spanish and it is enough to get them to leave.</p>
<p>Alberto sees a bus arrive and he goes into Special Forces Ninja mode to hide from the bus driver’s view.</p>
<p>Big Show emerges from his bus and he walks towards the building. He sees Del Rio and Del Rio takes a swing but he hits a window. Show tries to get into the car but Del Rio hits another window.</p>
<p>Show gets on top of the car to avoid Del Rio. Del Rio trips Show with the pipe and Show falls onto the car. Del Rio punches Show but Show pushes Del Rio off the car. Show begs for mercy.</p>
<p>Del Rio yells at Show in Spanish. Show runs to a car and he gets into it and drives away.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and it is time to take a look back at CM Punk confronting Rock’s celebration on Raw.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez walk in the back and Alberto tells Ricardo to stay in the back because he is hurt. Ricardo begs Alberto to allow him to go out but Alberto tells Ricardo to stay back and it appears that Alberto wins out.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Six: Dolph Ziggler (with AJ Lee and Big E Langston) versus Alberto Del Rio in a Non Title Match</strong></p>
<p>They lock up and Dolph works on the arm but Del Rio reverses and applies an arm bar. Ziggler with a punch and punches to Del Rio. Del Rio with a kick and punch in the corner followed by a slam and then Del Rio goes to the turnbuckles for a moonsault but Del Rio lands on his feet when Dolph moves. Del Rio sends Ziggler into the air and then he kicks Dolph and gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio charges into the corner but Ziggler moves and hits the ring post with his shoulder. Ziggler with a DDT for a near fall. Ziggler with kicks followed by a neck breaker and he gets a near fall. Ziggler with a leaping elbow drop for a near fall. Ziggler with a reverse chin lock.</p>
<p>Ziggler with a kick to the chest but Del Rio with a German suplex and both men are down. Del Rio with a kick to the back and then Del Rio signals that he is going up for a moonsault. AJ gets on the apron and Langston trips Del Rio and Del Rio lands awkwardly on the mat. Ziggler gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a baseball slide to Langston and then he hits a flapjack on Ziggler. Langston gets on the apron and he is sent to the back by the referee. Ziggler begs for the referee to reconsider his decision.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Ziggler punches Del Rio in the head. Del Rio with kicks to Ziggler but Ziggler with a kick to the knee. Ziggler with a drop kick to Del Rio for a near fall. Ziggler goes up top but Del Rio crotches him. Del Rio with a round kick to the side of the head and then Del Rio sets for a superplex and he hits it.</p>
<p>The referee starts his count but they get back to their feet. They exchange punches and kicks until Dolph gets the advantage. Ziggler misses a splash into the corner but Del Rio does not miss with a few clotheslines. Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker after Dolph misses a clothesline. Del Rio sets for the super kick and he connects.</p>
<p>Del Rio gets a near fall. Del Rio signals for the cross arm breaker and he floats over but Ziggler escapes and hits a Fameasser for a near fall. Del Rio with an Irish whip but Ziggler is sent into the ropes and Del Rio with shots to the back and then Del Rio hits a lungblower while Ziggler is in the ropes. Del Rio gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a kick to Ziggler and then he goes to the turnbuckles. Ziggler gets back to his feet and Ziggler counters Del Rio’s move off the turnbuckles with a drop kick and Dolph gets a near fall. Ziggler sets for the Zig Zag but Del Rio escapes and applies the float over into the cross arm breaker and Ziggler taps out.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>After the match, Del Rio celebrates in the ring, but Big Show appears on the TitanTron to rain on his parade. Show tells Alberto that he is back in the building. He says that he is not alone and he has a friend with him.</p>
<p>Show tells Alberto to get back into the ring or he will break Ricardo like a piece of straw. Show tells Alberto if he ever attacks him like that again, he will make sure that Del Rio wishes he did not get up that day. He will hurt Ricardo, he will hurt Alberto, and anyone who gets in his way.</p>
<p>He wants to know who Alberto thinks he is. He asks Alberto if he wants to see his little dog beg. Ricardo begs for mercy and then Show asks Alberto if he should let Ricardo go. Show agrees to let Ricardo go, but he knocks him out instead.</p>
<p>We go to the back where Ricardo is out cold. A referee calls for the medical staff to check on Ricardo. Alberto gets to the back to check on Ricardo. Alberto wants a doctor to get there as we go to credits.</p>

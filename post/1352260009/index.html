<p><strong>WWE SUPER SMACKDOWN REPORT: FALLS COUNT ANYWHERE; A PUB BRAWL FROM LAST NIGHT TURNS INTO A TAG MATCH TONIGHT; THE VICKIE STUFF IS NOT OVER; INTERCONTINENTAL TITLE MATCH</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-11-06 22:00:52</p>
<p>Do you remember on Raw when Miz left Team Punk? How about when Vince McMahon removed CM Punk and Ryback from the traditional Survivor Series Match? Do you remember the video that will make even TMZ blush at the potential inaccuracy? Who is the Apex Predator? We will find out tonight.</p>
<p>We are live, on tape, from Birmingham, United Kingdom and your announcers are Josh ‘Why do British people do such good American accents’ Mathews and John ‘Look Kids . . . yeah we know’ Layfield.</p>
<p>We take a look at last week’s Smackdown to see why we are having a Falls Count Anywhere Match between Randy Orton and Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>Alberto and Ricardo talk in the back and Matt Striker asks Alberto about whether last week was a harbinger of what is to come tonight. Alberto says that Randy had the advantage because he attacked Alberto from behind. Matt brings up the RKO from Monday. Alberto says that Randy attacked him from behind. Alberto says that there is only one predator in WWE. He will beat Randy all over the building. He will show that Randy is nothing more than a crying little girl.</p>

<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and it is time to take a look back at Brad Maddox’s comments from Raw about why he did what he did.</p>
<p>Randy Orton is in the interview area and Matt asks for his response. Randy says that he will go through the curtain to fight one of the most sadistic matches of his career so Alberto calling him names won’t affect him. He is not worried about Alberto’s mouth because he can back it up. They will not just go out there an fight. They will have to get a little sick and twisted. They will have to show that they can cross a line that most people will not be able to cross. Randy says that this is one of his favorite type of matches because he can show how sick and twisted he can get.</p>

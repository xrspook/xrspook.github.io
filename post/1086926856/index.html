      <p>Summary 9</p>
<p>AT THE OFFICE</p>
<p>Due to Sandra&rsquo;s crying, Mariana puts out a 911 call to Betty. Sandra notices Mario approaching and quickly gets up out of her chair and acts as though she is looking for something on Mariana desks. Mario notices that she has been crying and inquiries to the reason. Sandra informs him that she is ill with the flu. This answer seems to satifsy Mario as he turns his attention to the approaching Armando.</p>
<p>Mario wants to know about Betty&rsquo;s reaction to the card and if Armando was able to speak to her. Armando answers that Betty&rsquo;s reaction to the card was that it was &ldquo;nice&rdquo; and she informed him that he could not take her home because she has plans with her friends. Mario asks if she is taking the car and could it possibly be that she has plans with Nicolas. Armando says no. Betty asked him if he had a problem taking El Cuartel in the Mercedes and if he did, she and El Cuartel could take the bus. Mario tells Armando that he needs to take Betty out that evening. Armando would like to know how he thinks that is possible since Marcela is home. &ldquo;It is too risky&rdquo;, he says. He states that he doesn&rsquo;t have an excuse to give her.</p>
<p>At this point the elevator opens and inside is Patricia and Marcela. Armando and Mario hurriedly begin a conversation in regards to a cocktail that Armando does not want to attend with Mario. Marcela asks if Armando has a commitment with Mario. Armando answers that he does but that he does not want to attend. Marcela is happy because she and Armando need to speak. Armando says fine and that once he returns from a client&rsquo;s he will go to her so that they can speak.</p>
<p>Marcela tells Patricia that she can tell that Armando has plans for that evening. Patricia asks if she plans on ruining them. Marcela does not know. She tells her about Daniel invitation to the cocktail launching his new project. Patricia asks if she plans on inviting Armando. Marcela asks if Patricia will attend the event if Armando refuses. &ldquo;Me!&rdquo;, Patricia answers. She tells Marcela that she wouldn&rsquo;t attend even if she were dead. Marcela begs her. Patricia tells her that she has been invited to dinner and she does not plan to cancel. Marcela wants to know who invited her. Patricia does not want to answers and has a big smile on her face. Marcela begs for her to answer her question. At that moment, Betty passes by on her way to Sandra&rsquo;s desk. Patricia tells Marcela that the invitation is from Nicolas Mora. Right away the look on Marcela&rsquo;s face changes and it is obvious that she is not happy with the news. Marcela wants to know what she is talking about. Patricia tells her that she plans on taking Betty&rsquo;s boyfriend away from her. Marcela graps Patricia by the hand and takes her to her office.</p>
<p>AT SANDRA&rsquo;S DESK</p>
<p>Betty wants to know what is occurring. Sandra tells her about her conversation with Mario. Betty tells her not to worry that she could not keep promises to both of them. She thanks her for keeping her promise to her. Mariana wants to know what was in the package that Mario is so worried that she might have seen it. Betty says that she does not know, but it must have very important and that is why she returned it. Betty says the subject is closed. Mariana tells Sandra that her intuition tells her that Betty knows what was in the package.</p>
<p>IN FRONT OF ARMANDO&rsquo;S OFFICE</p>
<p>Jenny is speaking Efrain and is telling him that she is upset with him and that she is going to have to shut off her cellular telephone. Sophia, Aura Maria (wearing sunglasses, Sandra and Mariana approch where Jenny is standing. Jenny tells Efrain to hold and greets Sophia. She tells Efrian that she greeted Sophia because she knows decency and that she is calm. Sophia is excited because theere is a possibility that she may get to keep her house. She is even more excited because Efrain has not bothered to pay another dollar of support. She tells El Cuartel that la pupuchurra may be looking for Efrain&rsquo;s pajamas that have strips. Since he has not paid support there is a possiblity that he could be put in jail. El Cuartel is filled with excitement. Aura Maria gets excited and starts her regular screaming and says that they will have to go and celebrate and that Betty can take them in the Mercedes. As Aura Maria is telling her plans, jumping up and down, Freddy approaches from behind without Aura Maria noticing him. Bertha tries to warn her but she does not pay attention. Freddy wants to know if she plans on going out and in Betty&rsquo;s car. She tells him that they are just going out so that Mariana can read their cards. She puts her arms around him and he takes them off and walks away. She follows him and wants to know why he is upset. He tells her that she is going crazy over Betty&rsquo;s car. She says that she is not.</p>
<p>Freddy tells Aura Maria that now that she has a friend that has Mercedes she is ashamed of having a boyfriend that is a messenger. She tells him that it is not so and for him not to make things up. She tells him that some of the girls are having problems and that Mariana is just going to read their cards. He tells her that when she arrived he was surrounded by three models, however, he left them to give her an official kiss as her boyfriend. He tells her to have Mariana read her cards well because he is sure that there will be no Freddy in those cards. He tells her that she is hiding something behind the dark glasses.</p>
<p>Aura Maria jumps in Betty&rsquo;s office and wants to know what time they will be leaving. Betty stares. Aura Maria asks if she has forgotten about the card readings. Betty tells her that they will leave around 6:00. Aura Maria asks if she as advised her boyfriend of her plans. Betty says no. Aura Maria asks if he might not give permission and if he gets jealous. Betty says no and that she and Nicolas have a modern relationship. Aura Maria gives Betty her version of the plans for the evening. After the card readings, they will drop off Sofia and Inesita at their respective homes. Afterwards, with the car that they have they will be able to pick up any guy that they want. Betty tells her that she had not of that. Betty looks worried. Aura Maria tells her that she is charge of driving and to leave the rest to her.</p>
<p>IN MARCELA&rsquo;S OFFICE</p>
<p>Patricia is telling Marcela that Nicolas kept calling and insisting that she go out with him until she could no longer turn him down. Marcela says that she cannot go out with him because he is Betty&rsquo;s boyfriend. Patricia says that she is not going to let that group of witches make fun of her. She tells her that she is not the one the one that they make fun of and throw it in her face about his wealth, his having a business and cars. Marcela tells her that they may be witches but she is stupid. She tells her that the only reason that she is going out with him is so that he can solve her financial problems. Patricia looks shooked. She tells her that her suggestion makes her ill. She tells her that she shouldn&rsquo;t answer her and it&rsquo;s if Marcela doesn&rsquo;t know her. Marcela tells her that she does know her. Patricia tells her that they are just going out to dinner and all that she plans on doing is to flirt, put him down on her feet and then goodbye. She says that she has to do it to show El Cuartel that they cannot make fun of her. Marcela tells her that she does not like what she is planning. Patricia tells her that she doesn&rsquo;t care that she is going to go out with him. Patricia wants to know why is on Betty&rsquo;s side if Betty is her worst enemy. Marcela answers that what she is doing is not right. Marcela asks what time they plan on going out. Patricia gets all excited and starts swinging her hair when she tells her of their plans. She says that she is going to look &ldquo;divina&rdquo;. She then asks Marcela to lend her one of the outfits that she brought back from Palm Beach.</p>
<p>BETTY&rsquo;S OFFICE</p>
<p>Nicolas calls and wants to know when Betty is coming home. Betty tells him that she will be leaving soon. He lies to her and tells her that he will go and pick up the car at her house in order to put it in his mother&rsquo;s store room. Betty tells him that she will not be going straight home. Nicolas gets excited and wants to know why. Betty tells him that she is going out with her friends. He tells her that she can&rsquo;t do that. Betty wants to know why. He tells her that she cannot drive well willand that her father will be upset with her. (As he is telling Betty this he is looking at Patricia&rsquo;s picture and caressing it with a brush.) Betty tells him that she can always leave the car in the company&rsquo;s parking garage. Nicolas says no that it won&rsquo;t be safe. Betty asks how would he know. Betty wants to know what is going on. Nicolas tells her that he is worried about her. Betty adds, &ldquo;and the car&rdquo;. Nicolas tells her that is not so. Betty tells him that if she arrives home early she will call him. Nicolas turns to Patricia&rsquo;s picture and tells her that they have serious problems. He tells the picture that he doesn&rsquo;t think that she would ride a bus. He tells it not to worry that he will come up with something and that he does not plan on not making the date. He takes her picture to the mirror and kisses it.</p>
<p>BY SANDRA AND MARIANA&rsquo;S DESKS</p>
<p>Marcela comes by and asks for Armando. Mariana answers that he is stillin product. Patricia is getting ready to go home. She tells Marcela that she plans on taking a taxi and borrows money from Marcela to pay for it. As Marcela is giving it to her she tells her to be careful with what she does. Armando and Mario arrive and Marcela tells him that Daniel invited them to a cocktail party. Armando wants to know if he was invited. Marcela says that she would like for him to go with her. Armando tells her to go ahead and they will meet up later. After Marcela leaves Mario tells Armando that this is his opporunity to take Betty out.</p>
<p>BETTY&rsquo;S OFFICE</p>
<p>Betty is talking to Aura Maria and is telling her that she will be leaving shortly. As she is talking Armando walks in and after Betty hangs up he tells her to break her commitment with her friends. Betty asks, &ldquo;What?&rdquo; She reminds him that she had told him about her previous engagement and that she has a car so there is no need for him to drive her home. He tells her to cancel it that they are leaving. She tells him that it would be best if they left it for next week. Armando approaches her desk and sits down. He tells her that he knows that she has a car, but that they need to talk. She begins to interrupt him and he gets upset and starts yelling. He tells her that they need to talk and that they will find a place to ptalk. He tells her that she needs to make him her priority, not Nicolas or her friends. He says that if she no longer wants anything to do with him that she needs to tell him so to his face. He tells her that she has to have respect for what they have. While Armando speaks, Betty just stares. She tells him that he is going to have problems with Marcela. He answers that Marcela will be HIS problem and that he has already made arrangements with her. He tells her that he will not accept any excuse and that he has been trying to speak to her for a long time. Betty won&rsquo;t look at him. He tells her that if she wants to stay quite, that is fine. He will take that as a signal that she no longer wants anything to do with him and that they will both go their own ways. She can do whatever she likes.</p>
<p>Betty begins to talk with a firmer voice. She asks him if it bothers him that she may keep his company and spend his money. He tells her that he will not respond and tells her that they need to go somewhere else to talk. Betty gets out of her chair and tells him that she will return his company. She tells him that she will call Nicolas and tell him to bring all the books. Armando wants to know if he will now have to discuss their relationship with Nicolas. He says to call him. He is sure that Betty has told him everything that is going on between them and broken her promises to him. Betty turns around and says, &ldquo;Oh, I am the one who has broken all the promises. I&rsquo;m the one deceiving you&rdquo;. Armando and Betty stare at each other. Armando wants to know what he is suppose to think with everything that she is doing to him. He asks once more that they go somewhere to talk. Betty tells him that she will cancel her commitment and that they will leave. Armando very upset gets up and leaves. After he turns around Betty sticks out her tongue at him and then focuses on her candle.</p>
<p>IN ARMANDO&rsquo;S OFFICE</p>
<p>Marcela comes in to say goodbye. Marcela wants to know if he found out anything about Betty&rsquo;s boyfriend because Daniel was worried about the Mercedes. Armando tells him that he has already checked him out and for her and Daniel to calm down because everything is fine. (Betty is listening to all of this in her office.) Marcela wants him to go look at some apartments the next day. She kisses him goodbye and he does not return the kiss. Marcela tells him that he does not have much longer to get the other woman out of his system or her.</p>
<p>BETTY&rsquo;S OFFICE</p>
<p>Armando walks in and asks if she is ready to leave. Betty tells him to go ahead and leave and that she will be leaving soon. He looks puzzled. She tells him that he has his car and she has hers. He asks if she means that they will be leaving in separate cars. She says yes. He tells her that they will be leaving together in his car. Armando leaves her no choice. Betty tells him that she needs to make a call. Mario comes in and asks to speak to Armando. They go to the conference room. Betty hangs up and goes to listen to the conversation.</p>
<p>CONFERENCE ROOM</p>
<p>Armando informs Mario that he has convinced Betty to go out with him. Mario is excited and tells him that this is the night to get Betty back. He tells him to take her out to eat, dance, make love to her. Do what is necessary. Spend any amount of money that is necessary. Make whatever sacrifice is necessary, but the monster needs to arrive at work tomorrow in love with the President. He tells him that they are running out of time and Betty needs to fix the report. Armando says that he is totally aware, but he doesn&rsquo;t know where to take her. Mario suggests a place that is out of the way and dark. He says that to the monster this place will seem &ldquo;divino&rdquo;. Betty hears the whole conversation and walks off furious.</p>
<p>AT BETTY&rsquo;S HOUSE</p>
<p>Nicolas arrives in his new suit. He turns around so that her parents can get a good look at him. He wants to know if Betty has called and what time she plans on arriving home. Dona Julia says that they have not heard. Nicolas says that she had plans on going out with her friends. Her mother says that she would not go without advising them. Don Hermes says that she does what she wants. He says that he is able to go pick her up but that she rather be in the Mercedes. Dona Julia asks where the car is, has it be stolen. Nicolas says no, that it is worse. Betty took it to work. Don Hermes wants to know how irresponsible can he be.</p>
<p>Betty calls home to let her parents know that she will be late. Nicolas wants to know what time she will be home. He asks that she come home soon. Betty tells her mother that she will be attending a dinner with Armando. She tells them that Armando will be bringing her home and that she will leave the car in the parking garage. Nicolas rushes to speak to her and to tell her that he will pick it up. Armando comes for Betty. Nicolas is upset that Betty has decided to put the car in the garage. He finally convinces her to let him pick it up. Armando wants to know if there is a problem. She says no that Nicolas was worried about where she planned on leaving the car.</p>
<p>Betty wants to ask Armando for one favor. He asks what it is and she says that she wants to pick the place. He says fine and when she mentions El Meson de San Diego he refuses. He tells her that it is a restuarant where his class of people go to, people that are his friends, people that know both him and Marcela. She asks what is the problem, won&rsquo;t they just go to talk. He says yes, but that he wants something more intimate. She tells him that she doesn&rsquo;t care to go to one of those dark dance clubs that he always picks. Besides, she had plans to go out to a nice place with her friends. She tells him that it would be best if they wait until next week when she is in a better mood. She tells him that she understands how uncomfortable and embarrassing it must be for him to go to a place like that with someone like her. He agrees to go to the restaurant.</p>
<p>IN THE LOBBY</p>
<p>El Cuartel is waiting for Betty. Aura Maria is ready to go. Betty tells her that she needs to accompany Armando to a meeting. Aura Maria is upset that Betty will leave them all dressed and no where to go. Armando is just staring at Aura Maria. Inesita says that she thinks it is best. She did not like the idea of going in that car at night. Aura Maria wants to know what car Betty will be going in. Betty says Armando&rsquo;s. Aura Maria gets excited and asks to borrow the car. El Cuartel starts in on Aura Maria. Sophia tells her to start walking because she has her son at home.</p>
<p>Freddy comes out of the elevator and wants to know what is going on. Aura Maria rushes to his side and tells him that she told El Cuartel that they should go out some other evening because she wanted to be with him. Freddy falls for the story.</p>
<p>AT BETTY&rsquo;S HOUSE</p>
<p>Nicolas is very impatient adn is pounding the table. Dona Julia offers him something to eat. He tells her no because he has a good dinner waiting for him. SHe notices what he said and tells him that he has dinner waiting at home for him. After Betty&rsquo;s parents leave the room he takes out Patricia&rsquo;s picture and kisses it and gets some money.</p>
<p>IN PATRICIA&rsquo;S BATHROOM</p>
<p>Patricia is talking to her father about her date. She&rsquo;s wearing a short, tight, black leather top and skirt combing her hair. She tells him that he works for a solid company and that he has money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s big date night for Nícolas and he&rsquo;s off to Ecomoda to collect the Benz. He approaches the building and Wilson looks him over. Nícolas first shows off with a fake phone call and then introduces himself and his purpose, but Wilson makes him prove that he is who he says he is. Nícolas shows him his ID, noting that the photo is from when he was &ldquo;poor&rdquo;. He shows off his watch and Wilson asks if it&rsquo;s a toy. However, Wilson is impressed with the Benz&rsquo;s remote control—though Nícolas only manages to open the trunk! He asks Wilson to shut it and he hops to it. Nícolas tells him that he Betty will give him a tip tomorrow and enters the car and is off to dreamland, coattail dragging out the door!</p>
<p>Armando and Betty pull up in front of the nightclub — he with his long-suffering look and her noting it quite clearly — he notes that the place is crawling with &ldquo;his kind of people&rdquo; and he tries to put her off. She tells him to trust in her good luck. Some goofy mime in sparkly whiteface and zebra-topped hat opens the door for her. Armando gets out and scarcely waits for her to join him before he enters the outside terrace of the club. He&rsquo;s greeted left and right and he pretends as if he&rsquo;s alone, not introducing Betty. She gets fed up with this after the first 4 or 5 people and shows him up by introducing herself. Armando cringes — he doesn&rsquo;t even have the grace to look shamed by his behavior… yet.</p>
<p>Inside, they&rsquo;re seated at a nice table. It&rsquo;s bright, well lit, and a trio of men are singing/playing a light rock/pop type song. Armando takes a seat and doesn&rsquo;t pull out the chair for Betty. She looks at him, disapprovingly. &ldquo;Sit down, please,&rdquo; he tells her abruptly, and she pauses, &ldquo;Betty, sit down…&rdquo; chides Armando. Before she does — the waiter has pulled out the chair for her — she asks Armando if he&rsquo;ll loan her his cell phone. He looks annoyed at the request, &ldquo;Why do you want it? What now, Beatriz?&rdquo; &ldquo;I need to call home,&rdquo; she responds. He looks suspiciously at her as he pulls it from his back pocket and hands it over. She leaves and he orders a whisky, for now.</p>
<p>Nícolas, meanwhile, has pulled up in front of Patricia&rsquo;s apartment building and is calling her to let her know he&rsquo;s arrived. While he&rsquo;s waiting for her, he does a quick check of his &ldquo;date-worthiness.&rdquo; He sniffs his pits and dusts them with some talcum powder he handily has in the glove box of the car; and then dusts his shoes liberally also. Next is some cologne, which he dabs on with his fingers. He checks his breath and finds that he could use a mint, but with no mints at hand, he takes a swig of the cologne. It&rsquo;s nasty, but he persists and decides he needs more freshening so he takes a bigger swig and spits out the excess out the car door. The cell phone rings, startling him, and it&rsquo;s Betty. She is in full panic mode and pleads with him to come to the club to pick her up. &ldquo;What?!?&rdquo; he exclaims. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nícolas, come and take me away from her, I don&rsquo;t know what to say to you…&rdquo; &ldquo;Wait, Betty, who are you with, where are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;With Don Armando,&rdquo; she tells him. &ldquo;He asked that we go out tonight to speak about us,&rdquo; she continues. She tells Nícolas how Armando proposed that they go to one of the usual out of the way places and how she told him that she didn&rsquo;t want to do that — she wanted to make him suffer — and she asked him to bring her to this exclusive club. &ldquo;But since we&rsquo;ve entered he&rsquo;s been greeted by all these people and he hasn&rsquo;t introduced me to anyone,&rdquo; she complains, clearly upset by Armando&rsquo;s behavior. Nícolas sees things clearly, &ldquo;Sorry, but you&rsquo;re being very stupid. Think of all the things he&rsquo;s done to humiliate you. Remember what the letter said, how he&rsquo;s suffered. No, what are you thinking?&rdquo; Betty is near tears, &ldquo;I only wanted to make him uncomfortable a bit, but to also respect me… It&rsquo;s to speak of business and what&rsquo;s happening between us, but I wanted to do it in a nice place. But I was wrong… Take me away from here, Nícolas! I want to go! If you won&rsquo;t come for me, I&rsquo;ll take a taxi!&rdquo; He encourages her to wait a minute. He stretches out in the Benz and elaborates. &ldquo;It seems like an interesting plan.&rdquo; He reminds her that they&rsquo;re together and this is an opportunity to make Armando suffer her company as a fea. &ldquo;Remember?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says a tearful Betty. He continues and tells her Laying it on thick — that he&rsquo;s gotten home, he&rsquo;s putting on his pajamas (yawn) and he&rsquo;s going to bed. She tells him that she&rsquo;ll call him later at home, knowing she&rsquo;s really stuck with going ahead with her plan, but he tells her to use the cell phone — so as to not disturb mama. She pulls herself together and heads out to Armando.</p>
<p>Back to Nícolas&rsquo; date preparations. He takes a Q-tip from his breast pocket and swabs out the ears, and then (brace yourselves) he puts the used swab back in his pocket! Finally, he blows his nose and checks the nostrils to make sure that no boogers lurk, then tucks the tissue up his sleeve. He&rsquo;s just finished up when he sees Patricia standing outside the building. He&rsquo;s struck dumb by how great she looks — better than in his photo. He hops out of the car and greets her. She puts on full vamp mode and when he offers his hand to shake she steps forward and plants a kiss on his cheek. He&rsquo;ll never wash his face again! He opens the door and she gets in. Inside the car, she asks if she was late and he says no. She holds her fingers to her nose because of his cologne-breath. He tells her that he gave his chauffeur the night off because he likes to drive and they&rsquo;re so indiscreet. She asks where they will go and he tells her he can&rsquo;t decide because he&rsquo;s so demanding. She suggests Ile l&rsquo;Noir and he concurs, but needs to ask her how to get there. She looks at him peculiarly.</p>
<p>Back at the club, Betty returns to the table and hands Armando his phone. He asks how it went and she says, &ldquo;Good, you know how my father is.&rdquo; He asks her to sit and she thanks him again and apologizes for the delay. The waiter asks her what she&rsquo;d like to drink and Armando begins to order her usual jugo de mora, but Betty interrupts and tells the waiter she&rsquo;d like a vodka, straight up. This surprises Armando and he notes the order. &ldquo;Vodka? I didn&rsquo;t think you drank? Why vodka?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, Doctor, as I&rsquo;ve never been to a place like this before, it seems to me a good occasion to have a vodka. Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo; (Slightly evil grin on her face). He replies, a pained look on his face, &ldquo;Yes… of course…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia is instructing Nícolas on how to get to Ile l&rsquo;Noir. He puts on some music (&ldquo;Andiamo&rdquo; from &ldquo;la Boheme&rdquo;) at full blast. He asks if she likes it, but it&rsquo;s too loud. She asks him to turn it down. She next asks him what Betty thinks about him being out. He tells her that he told her that he had a business meeting, besides, she&rsquo;s involved in something for Ecomoda.</p>
<p>Armando starts to broach the topics in front of him: he wants to know what crime he&rsquo;s committed for her to treat him with such distance. She stares at him with a fixed smile. It&rsquo;s given him such fear and he hopes that they&rsquo;ll leave, &ldquo;Pues… bien,&rdquo; he says, with a shy smile. He offers up a toast, for business and for their night. She lifts her glass and drains it, to his amazement, then orders another. &ldquo;Betty! What are you doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;I was toasting us… for our night together… (haw haw)!&rdquo; He wants to begin to speak about the car and Terra Moda and them, but a woman comes up behind him and greets him effusively. She kisses him and flirts, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re married yet?&rdquo; He says that he nearly is and she tells him to drop his fiancée and marry her instead. He looks awkwardly at Betty and Betty looks daggers with her eyes and polite smile on her lips at the two. He introduces Betty as his assistant and the woman dismissively says, &ldquo;a pleasure&rdquo; and turns back to Armando. Betty, takes things further and replies with the unanticipated, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure&hellip; We&rsquo;re delighted to have you here!&rdquo; making her point that she&rsquo;s actually sitting at the table with Armando. The flirt teases him and tells him to call her before he marries and Betty takes action by calling for the waiter. &ldquo;Am I interrupting something?&rdquo; asks the flirt. Armando explains that he and his assistant were speaking of work. The flirt finds this a horrible topic for a night out but new NAI (New and Improved) Betty puts forth her opinion, &ldquo;But we enjoy it (talking about business) so much!&rdquo; The flirt graciously gets the hint and takes her leave. Betty, however, gets the last word, &ldquo;Hasta luego. Fue un placer para conocerte&hellip; Qué te vuelvas&hellip;&rdquo; Armando looks troubled/Betty looks grim. &ldquo;What shame&hellip;&rdquo; remarks Betty, pointedly, &ldquo;Do you want to go to a more discreet place?&rdquo; Armando hastily remarks — and he looks a little as if he means it for a change; &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no need for that. We&rsquo;re fine here.&rdquo; The waiter brings her next vodka and she knocks this one back too. He&rsquo;s concerned that she&rsquo;s drinking so fast, but she just explains that it&rsquo;s just because she&rsquo;s so happy to be with him, that, &ldquo;At last we&rsquo;re having our night!&rdquo; He chuckles low and awkwardly, &ldquo;Me too, I&rsquo;m content too.&rdquo; They listen to the lead singer. &ldquo;I have a world of my own, I&rsquo;m going to share it&hellip; This is my world&hellip; my world&hellip;&rdquo; Betty asks if he&rsquo;s listening to the music (but are you hearing the words?) and he apologetically confesses that he was a bit.</p>
<p>Back to the uncomfortable topics&hellip; He starts again and another woman kisses him hello. He starts again on the topic of her salary. He wants to give her the raise that he&rsquo;d promised her commensurate with her responsibilities but she so rightly tells him that Ecomoda can&rsquo;t afford to pay her what she&rsquo;s worth: Ecomoda can&rsquo;t pay her for what she does with Terra Moda. Ecomoda can&rsquo;t pay her create illegal figures. He&rsquo;s startled by this frankness and looks at her, head tilted to one side, and tries another tack. &ldquo;Yes, but you could draw a salary from Terra Moda.&rdquo; &ldquo;That would be unjust,&rdquo; she responds. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t do anything with Terra Moda. The one who does is Nícolas Mora, who works full time for Terra Moda and I&rsquo;ve already arranged a salary for him.&rdquo; Armando is clearly uncomfortable but trying not to start anything, &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve fixed one (a salary for Nícolas), good.&rdquo; He suggests that perhaps she should receive a commission if not a salary but she tells him not to think of it. This topic&rsquo;s at a dead-end so he starts in on the car. He tells her that he knows he promised to get her a car and he&rsquo;s sorry that he didn&rsquo;t before. She tells him that she&rsquo;s more than happy with the Benz, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not satisfied that I stick with the Mercedes, I could&hellip;&rdquo; Armando sees a slippery slope ahead and starts retracting, &ldquo;Nooo&hellip; It&rsquo;s perfect for you to have this car. &quot; Betty has a strange, fixed expression on her face. He goes on to tell her that he&rsquo;s in accord with her expenditures, such as for the luncheon she hosted with the cuartel. He&rsquo;d perhaps like to suggest a figure for these types of expenses. She tells him not to worry, she and Nícolas have already calculated how much they have available for these types of expenses. &ldquo;However, if you&rsquo;d like to discuss them, or have us lower this monthly expense&hellip;&rdquo; Betty suggests, very passive/aggressive in tone. He can do nothing but agree. They listen again to the music again for a bit. Armando speaks again, &ldquo;You make a good team with Nícolas&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; smiles Betty. Armando hesitantly puts forth that he&rsquo;s glad that Nícolas didn&rsquo;t come pick her up this night, that she would make him a gift of this night together. Betty smiles and tells him not to worry about Nícolas, he should be in bed by now. &ldquo;Health, to the two of us!&rdquo; She drinks down her third vodka, to Armando&rsquo;s chagrin.</p>
<p>Nícolas and Patricia are close to the restaurant and now he pretends to recall where he is. He drives up and gets out, shaking off the excess powder. He calls to the doorman to hurry up and open her door. She exits as slinkily as possible and Nícolas follows her up the steps as geeky as they come. At the top, he tries to lock the car with his remote but only starts the alarm. He succeeds with the next try. He tells the doorman to keep an eye on the car and wait for the tip.</p>
<p>Inside, the maitre d&rsquo; greets her and tells Patricia he hasn&rsquo;t seen her in a while. She pretends that the work has kept her too busy to come. The maitre&rsquo;d mentions that some of her company was there for lunch. Patricia looks a little sour and Nícolas a little surprised. She wonders if he knows that Betty said that he was paying and he expansively that he&rsquo;s very generous with her. The maitre&rsquo;d asks if they have a reservation and when they don&rsquo;t, Nícolas acts like a jerk implying that he&rsquo;s an important person, whipping out his card, that they should have a table for him, and Patricia just looks pleadingly at him. For her, he leads the odd couple to a table. Nícolas sits right down (shades of Armando!) while Patricia stands waiting, surprised at his ill manners. Nícolas tells the maitre&rsquo;d to pull out her chair and hurry up. He asks Nícolas if he can take his trench coat, but Nícolas tells him he&rsquo;ll leave it on. The waiter asks if they&rsquo;d like something to drink. Nícolas wants to impress her and tells her to order whatever&hellip; champagne. &ldquo;No, it seems too extravagant&hellip; &quot; she purrs. She counters with cognac and Nícolas says that he was thinking the same thing. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re of identical minds,&rdquo; he says gleefully, &ldquo;Joven, bring us a bottle of your best cognac&hellip; oh and two glasses!&rdquo; Startled, the maitre d&rsquo; can only comply. &ldquo;Venga, venga, venga&hellip; ¡y rapidito!&rdquo; calls Nícolas. Patricia looks embarrassed, but it&rsquo;s clear that she&rsquo;s thinking this is going to be easy, hooking a yokel like Nícolas.</p>
<p>Back at the club&hellip; They&rsquo;re pensive, listening to the music. Armando says that he doesn&rsquo;t want their dealings with Terra Moda and Ecomoda to compromise their relationship. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been very worried by what&rsquo;s been going on lately, Beatriz.&rdquo; She stares fixedly at the musicians, swaying lightly to the music . &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just that, during these days, I haven&rsquo;t been able to sleep.&rdquo; Someone passes behind him and he&rsquo;s momentarily distracted. Betty chuckles, perhaps at the idea of a sleepless Armando. He wants to clarify things between them, they have to talk. All the other stuff — the car, the expense, etc. — that&rsquo;s all clear between them, right. Betty nods her head goofily, the drink clearly affecting her. &ldquo;Clear, Doctor, very clear!&rdquo; Armando wants to proceed. &ldquo;What is happened between the two of us?&rdquo; He gestures with his hands and she says, &ldquo;Naaaadaaaa, Doctooor&hellip;,&rdquo; and reaches out to caress his wrist affectionately. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very well&hellip;&rdquo; She caresses his hands further and he looks at her hand on his and tries to move his hand away without appearing to. He pulls back to rub his chin, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re that well (tucks his hands under his arms), because things have been very difficult, you&rsquo;ve been very strange with me (she fixes a knowing smile on him). Besides, you&rsquo;ve wanted to be more with Nícolas Mora than with me&hellip;&rdquo; he complains. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; He gestures again with his hands and she playfully reaches out to caress his hand again, grinning broadly. &ldquo;Where did you get that idea, Doctor?&rdquo; she laughs. He extricates his hands and says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play, Beatriz! Don&rsquo;t play!&rdquo; He insists that she explain what&rsquo;s going on with her and Nícolas Mora. &ldquo;Naadaaa, Doctor! How could you think so?&rdquo; Haw haw. He fixes her with a look. He starts to make a point, bringing his hands forward, but catches himself and tucks them back under his arms so that she can&rsquo;t play with his fingers again. &ldquo;You remember that once you told me that you loved me&hellip; do you remember?&rdquo; He pauses, &ldquo;Have you forgotten it?&rdquo; Betty hangs her head, chin in her hand, eyes down. He looks at her with a slightly hurt look, &ldquo;Do you not love me now?&rdquo; She looks away. &ldquo;Tell me, because I need to know, Beatriz.&rdquo; He oozes sincerity — dare we believe him? She thinks for several long seconds, then turns resolutely to look him in the face, &ldquo;No, Doctor, I still love you (laugh).&rdquo; He looks down, as if to hide his relief, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to have to forgive me, but I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo; he continues. Oh, the look in her eyes&hellip;! &ldquo;Ah no?&rdquo; she asks him. He pulls his head up proudly and looks away. She gets up from her chair opposite and takes the seat next to him, pulling up closely. She runs her fingers up his arm and starts to pull closer. &ldquo;What are you doing, Beatriz?&rdquo; he asks in mild alarm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to show you that I love you, Doctor.&rdquo; She pulls in for a kiss. &ldquo;Nooo&hellip;&rdquo; he pulls back, voice rising in denial. Betty responds in frustration, &ldquo;But how do you want me to show you that I love you? You act so evasive with me!&rdquo; Laugh, laugh. He looks a little startled at this, worried that the people behind them may have noticed them, &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he begins and another girl kisses him hello and dashes off. He starts again, &ldquo;Look, we&rsquo;re in a place were people know me; we can&rsquo;t do anything here and you know it!&rdquo; She laughs drunkenly, &ldquo;I forgot! I forgot that you can only be affectionate with me in hidden little getaways, in dark corners&hellip;&rdquo; She laughs again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for you, Beatriz, it&rsquo;s for Marcela,&rdquo; he says, teeth clenched. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s for Doña Marcela&hellip; but, you&rsquo;ve been with many other women in places like this one and it never mattered to you before.&rdquo; Armando tells her that that was different. &ldquo;Very different,&rdquo; responds Betty with alacrity, &ldquo;because you had been there with very beautiful women. And this isn&rsquo;t prestigious, this doesn&rsquo;t damage your record. On the contrary, the people applaud you. On the other hand, with me you run all the risk with Do–a Marcela,&rdquo; Betty is mocking and he looks hurt by what she&rsquo;s saying. She continues to say that what really troubles him isn&rsquo;t Marcela knowing he&rsquo;s affectionate with her, but that the people there see them. THAT would hurt his image.&rdquo; He impulsively responds, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, it&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo; (Is this the Armando who comforted Betty in Mario&rsquo;s apartment and made love truly?) Betty replies, cynically, &ldquo;No? In truth?&rdquo; she grabs his neck and he flinches. She pulls back. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t you that&rsquo;s behaving strangely in all this, Doctor?&rdquo; He starts to panic and begs that she stop playing, let him take her home, to some other place, so that they can discuss this. She won&rsquo;t let him off the hook and continues to mock herself and him; she notes that the places he always takes her are dark, &ldquo;Of course that’s better for him because he doesn&rsquo;t have to see whom he&rsquo;s kissing!&rdquo; He&rsquo;s really startled by this and her drunken, self-deprecating laugh. Armando tells her that they&rsquo;d agreed on meeting in dark places, but she&rsquo;s right back at him by reminding him that when he finishes with Marcela they wouldn&rsquo;t hide anymore. He quickly replies that that&rsquo;s true but he&rsquo;s not finished with Marcela and he sees her every day in the light. &ldquo;Sure, Doctor! In the light of my office!&rdquo; mocks Betty. He gives her a quick look to interpret this latest comment. He reminds her that he&rsquo;s offered her another office several times but she&rsquo;s turned him down. She seizes on this, &ldquo;Yes, to stay closer to you!&rdquo; &ldquo;Look, Beatriz, you can punish me for the darkness, not for neglect.&rdquo; He tells her that the dark is for her benefit, she laughs and he tells her that she can laugh if she wishes, for when it&rsquo;s dark, he feels her most, in his heart. She stops laughing, &ldquo;This love of ours, Doctor, is going to turn into vampire love! (laugh) Because it ceases with the sun&hellip;&rdquo; She continues be agreeing that the darkness is inherent to the nature of their relationship, she understands well enough, don&rsquo;t worry. Armando responds with hurt in his voice that he doesn&rsquo;t feel that they&rsquo;re resolving things. He presses on that the clandestine nature of their relationship doesn&rsquo;t alter how he feels, what he loves&hellip; that he loves her, he pauses for effect. &ldquo;That I love you&hellip; But I feel that there&rsquo;s something else separating us!&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; responds Betty, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Everything you&rsquo;ve done, all of your moods towards me has a name: Nícolas Mora.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nícolas?&rdquo; laughs Betty incredulously. &ldquo;Yes. Why are you laughing? Just when you changed towards me he appeared.&rdquo; He recounts the many recent occasions when Nícolas has intruded between them, particularly getting angry when he mentions the changing of dates with him. Betty is enjoying this. She leans back and with a big grin says, &ldquo;So, you insist that I have something going with Nícolas?&rdquo; Armando tells her that he does and she laughs quietly. &ldquo;Do you believe that what I feel for Nícolas is more important that what I feel for you?&rdquo; He stares at her penetratingly. She leans over and draws close to him, pulling him to her lips. &ldquo;Will you help me prove that that&rsquo;s not so?&rdquo; she asks. &ldquo;How can I do that?&rdquo; he responds furtively. &ldquo;Kiss me, kiss me a lot,&rdquo; she says. He resists with his eyes only, rolling them the way he did when he first kissed her. Before they can hit full liplock mode, his cell phone rings. &ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; he says, in relief. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Marcela.&rdquo; He excuses himself to answer it in the bathroom.</p>
<p>In the bathroom, he speaks faux-sweetly to Marcela, telling her where he is, how long he&rsquo;ll be, asking where she is, etc., and signs off, &ldquo;Besos!&rdquo; Then he gets the idea to check whether or not Betty actually called home. He reviews the numbers dialed on his phone and discovers that her call wasn&rsquo;t to her home number&hellip;!</p>
<p>Niki and Patty are seated in the expensive restaurant, chatting. He still has his overcoat on. Patty asks Niki what TerraModa does, and he responds that they do investments over the internet. She says that she is very interested in anything involving the market, (of course, anything involving money would be interesting to her.)</p>
<p>She asks what kind of food he likes, and he turns the question on her. She talks about all sorts of foreign food, Italian, Japanese, especially the wok, and goes on and on. He says he likes all of those too, see, they have so much in common.</p>
<p>Then a phone rings. He says it must be hers, and she says no, it must be his. He tries to ignore it, but it continues to ring, so he excuses himself awkwardly from the table and goes to the restroom to answer it. He looks at the numbers, recognizing them as Armando&rsquo;s phone and says, oh, no, it must be Betty, and prepares to pretend that he is home, practicing yawning, etc., before answering. Armando speaks in a high pitched voice, saying &ldquo;I think I have the wrong number, who is this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nicholas Mora, who is this?&rdquo; Armando hangs up and gets very upset, talking to himself in the mirror. &ldquo;Nicholas Mora, Nicholas Mora, - -oh, so we know what you have been doing. You want to play, okay, we&rsquo;ll play&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter comes to the table and asks if Patty and Nicholas are ready to eat, Patty says that she doesn&rsquo;t have much &ldquo;Fam&rdquo;, but if he is ready, and he responds that he is starving, and can&rsquo;t wait to eat. They look at the menus together, and it is clear that Nicholas doesn&rsquo;t recognize anything. Patty asks what dishes he likes, and Nicholas says, oh, all of them, as he flips through the pages, hurriedly, looking for something familiar. She suggests some dishes, including oysters or scallops on the ½ shell. Then the waiter asks about the wine, and Nicholas has no idea what should go with anything, so Patty steps in and suggests white wine, and he goes along with that.</p>
<p>He heads back to the table and Betty is turned away from his direction, listening to the band with her chin in her hand. He sits down, but still she doesn&rsquo;t notice him, so he clears his throat. She asks him if he has to go, and he says no, why? She responds that he was gone so long she thought he had a problem with Marcela. He said that she was gone longer, and she said no, she didn&rsquo;t think so, but maybe it seemed like it because she missed him so much. He repeated no, and asked her to remind him of where they were. She says that she was going to show him how much she loves him, that she feels nothing for Nicholas, wraps one arm around his neck and leans in very close. He doesn&rsquo;t move away, instead looks directly at her and says really, she doesn&rsquo;t feel anything for Nicholas? Then why did she lie to him and say she was calling her house when she was calling Nicholas instead, huh? What is that about! She is deceiving him. She pulls away and says for him not to shout at her. He responds that she is acting shamelessly. &quot; I am shameless?&rdquo; she questions. She says that he has offended her and she is not going to take it, and she gets up to leave. He grabs her arm, and pulls her close to him, saying that she will stay, but she responds that he is making a scene, that these are his people, his group, that she doesn&rsquo;t care what they think of her, but he cares what they think of him. She then pushes past her, and he follows after her, saying &ldquo;Beatriz&rdquo;, one of his associates sees him on the way out, so he says hello without slowing down.</p>
<p>She is moving at a rapid clip down the street when he catches up to her and says that she has to talk to him, she can&rsquo;t leave. They can go back in and sit down and work everything out. She says, back in there, why? So he can reject and humiliate and ignore her again, because he is ashamed to be seen with her? He says that she shouldn&rsquo;t say that, it isn&rsquo;t true, she insists that it is. He insists that she is behaving disgracefully, and she says, how, because I am going around with two guys? He says, so then its over, we&rsquo;re finished? She says, unless you are willing to share me, because I am inclined to share myself. That&rsquo;s just the kind of woman I am.</p>
<p>He backs off and says, okay, so I made a mistake, I made a mistake, but this situation is making me crazy. You were teasing me in there, teasing and tempting me to kiss you, I need to kiss you. He grabs her and tries to kiss her, and she pulls away, and says no. He says I am dying to kiss you, dying, and he reaches for her again, stealing a brief kiss. No, she says, are you crazy. Yes, he responds, crazy for you, and I am going to kiss you. She says no, don&rsquo;t do it, and turns her head away. He grasps her chin and pulls her face towards his, firmly, and kisses her. She resists a little at first, then gives in. When they break, she pulls away and he tells her that he will make her forget Nicholas, he deserves her more because he loves and desires her, and kisses her again, but this time she doesn&rsquo;t respond. He pulls away and asks what is wrong, and she replies that she has to go. He says where? She says home. She turns and runs to catch a taxi, and waves goodbye - -Goodnight Doctor. Beatriz, wait, and he is standing next to her and shutting the door to prevent her from getting in, and he leans into her space. Don&rsquo;t get in, stay with me, we can go somewhere, somewhere where we can be alone, where I can show you how much I love and desire you. Where we can spend the night, the whole night together. She says that she has to go. He says, didn&rsquo;t you hear what I said? She responds, yes, Doctor, I heard you, and looking him directly in the eye, adds, but I don&rsquo;t want to be with you, I don&rsquo;t desire you. He releases her and she gets in the taxi and leaves.</p>
<p>Patty and Nicholas are receiving various plates of food, and as each one comes, Nicholas asks what it is, and the waiter says, it is what they ordered. The first plate (either oysters or scallops on the ½ shell, I forget which), floors him, and Patricia holds one of the ½ shells up for him to take. She is reaching for a fork, when he slups it directly out of the shell. This is the beginning of the end. Then the rest of the meal comes, I forget what it was, but Nicholas doesn&rsquo;t recognize this either, and asks what it is. Then, when he realizes that this is the main course, and is dismayed because, on par with most expensive restaurants, there is not much food on the plate, and he is hungry. He then proceeds to order lots of more filling dishes, including fried potatoes(I think). Patty is trying not to laugh at him, while feeling horrified at the same time. And he keeps referring to the waiter as joven, even though the waiter is probably older than he is. He also snaps his fingers and waves his hand around a lot in an affected, in charge manner.</p>
<p>Nicholas asks Patty if she lives with her mother, her father, a friend, or (gulp of discomfort) her boyfriend. She responds that she lives alone. She turns the question on him, and he responds that he too lives alone, but we see his squirm of discomfort, and we are reminded that he lives with his mother.</p>
<p>Patty then asks if Niki and Betty are going to get married, and he responds no, gosh no. She says that they seem very attached, and he responds no, not at all, it is a very independent relationship. She says that they must be very much in love, though, because he is so attentive and calls her all the time, gives her detalles, and lends her his car. He responds that a man doesn&rsquo;t have to be in love to do that, and she says no? (You can see the calculator working in her brain).</p>
<p>She tries to finagle the car, but Niki says he couldn&rsquo;t possibly, because he promised it to Betty. Patty then tries to secure his help in getting her car out of lockup, going on and on about how the embargo was a matter of bad luck. Niki alludes to being able to help her with that without promising anything. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can find a way to help.&rdquo; Patty - - Really, oh, how nice, I am so glad I met you. A toast to us!</p>
<p>Betty comes in the door, trying to tiptoe in, and is ambushed by her father in the blanket. He gives her the usual questions about how she got home, she says in taxi but accompanied. He asks if she talked to Armando about the car, and she replies yes, and that he is fine with everything. Armando has returned to the bar/club where they were. When the waiter asks if he wants the bill, he says no, a whisky. The musicians are singing &ldquo;te amo&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bill comes, and Nicholas pulls out a big wad of bills, and begins to count them - - he doesn&rsquo;t know how much he has, but it isn&rsquo;t going to be enough. He then pulls out the Terra Moda Checkbook, and starts writing, after a big show about the risks of taking checks, and toying with the waiter by pulling it back and forth out of his reach. Patty asks why he doesn&rsquo;t use credit, and he says, no credit is very bad - - the bills. Patty makes faces (we know she was hoping for access).</p>
<p>They come out of the restaurant and Niki tells the attendant to open the door for her, and that his tip is inside with the check he wrote to the restaurant.</p>
<p>Betty is in her room, writing in her diary. She can&rsquo;t believe she let Nicholas talk her into staying, she thought to get revenge, but it was a disaster, a disaster. Armando is sitting in the bar, drinking alone, listening to another song, the band is singing &ldquo;I miss you, I want that you had stayed with me.&rdquo; Betty is talking in the voiceover about how painful it is to know that he finds her repulsive, and he is touching his mouth, as if it were marked. Betty says he must be hurting for fear of his company the way she is hurting from his deception. He takes another sip, then jabs his fingers at his hair in frustration. She talks about how by now, he must be erasing all feeling of her, all memory of her with Marcela, and how she must avoid the temptation of being with him. Marcela calls, and asks what he is doing, and he replies that he is having a drink with a friend (male) and he will go back to his apartment after they are done. A friend says good night, and there are beautiful women everywhere, but he continues to drink alone. It was only her anger with him, at his reference to Nicholas being less, having less worth than he, that allowed her to pull back, and from now on she will have to keep her distance, because his skin, his kisses tempt her. She will have to keep her distance, until she can distance herself forever.</p>
<p>When Nicholas and Patty arrive at her home, she invites him up. You can tell he is tempted, but hesitates, and she says, oh, no, of course, and goes on and on about his relationship with Betty and how she respects that. She then hops out of the car (he looks like she hit him over the head) and gives a little wave. He calls after her, wait, wait, but she continues to walk away, and then turns back for another wave. After she is out of sight, he fawns all over the seat she sat in, touching it, even smelling it (the bottom of the seat no less!!!!)</p>
<p>It is morning and Don Hermes is complaining about not all of the skin being off of the papaya, and Dona Julia is rolling her eyes. Betty comes down, and Hermes starts in again about the car, and how even if Armando said it was okay, they shouldn&rsquo;t get too caught up, and Nicholas is turning into an idiot over the car and the clothes, and they shouldn&rsquo;t be confused about who they really were. Betty then opens the cupboard and shock! The checkbook and $$ from TerraModa are missing! She then thinks, ok, Niki probably moved them. Niki then shows up, after making lots of noise, and sits down at the table , giving Dona Julia &ldquo;his usual order&rdquo; and making lots of show. Hermes says that this is exactly what he was talking about, that they are both getting very caught up in all of this, and it needs to stop!</p>
<p>Niki and Patty are seated in the expensive restaurant, chatting. He still has his overcoat on. Patty asks Niki what TerraModa does, and he responds that they do investments over the internet. She says that she is very interested in anything involving the market, (of course, anything involving money would be interesting to her.)</p>
<p>She asks what kind of food he likes, and he turns the question on her. She talks about all sorts of foreign food, Italian, Japanese, especially the wok, and goes on and on. He says he likes all of those too, see, they have so much in common.</p>
<p>Then a phone rings. He says it must be hers, and she says no, it must be his. He tries to ignore it, but it continues to ring, so he excuses himself awkwardly from the table and goes to the restroom to answer it. He looks at the numbers, recognizing them as Armando&rsquo;s phone and says, oh, no, it must be Betty, and prepares to pretend that he is home, practicing yawning, etc., before answering. Armando speaks in a high pitched voice, saying &ldquo;I think I have the wrong number, who is this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nicholas Mora, who is this?&rdquo; Armando hangs up and gets very upset, talking to himself in the mirror. &ldquo;Nicholas Mora, Nicholas Mora, - -oh, so we know what you have been doing. You want to play, okay, we&rsquo;ll play&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter comes to the table and asks if Patty and Nicholas are ready to eat, Patty says that she doesn&rsquo;t have much &ldquo;Fam&rdquo;, but if he is ready, and he responds that he is starving, and can&rsquo;t wait to eat. They look at the menus together, and it is clear that Nicholas doesn&rsquo;t recognize anything. Patty asks what dishes he likes, and Nicholas says, oh, all of them, as he flips through the pages, hurriedly, looking for something familiar. She suggests some dishes, including oysters or scallops on the ½ shell. Then the waiter asks about the wine, and Nicholas has no idea what should go with anything, so Patty steps in and suggests white wine, and he goes along with that.</p>
<p>He heads back to the table and Betty is turned away from his direction, listening to the band with her chin in her hand. He sits down, but still she doesn&rsquo;t notice him, so he clears his throat. She asks him if he has to go, and he says no, why? She responds that he was gone so long she thought he had a problem with Marcela. He said that she was gone longer, and she said no, she didn&rsquo;t think so, but maybe it seemed like it because she missed him so much. He repeated no, and asked her to remind him of where they were. She says that she was going to show him how much she loves him, that she feels nothing for Nicholas, wraps one arm around his neck and leans in very close. He doesn&rsquo;t move away, instead looks directly at her and says really, she doesn&rsquo;t feel anything for Nicholas? Then why did she lie to him and say she was calling her house when she was calling Nicholas instead, huh? What is that about! She is deceiving him. She pulls away and says for him not to shout at her. He responds that she is acting shamelessly. &quot; I am shameless?&rdquo; she questions. She says that he has offended her and she is not going to take it, and she gets up to leave. He grabs her arm, and pulls her close to him, saying that she will stay, but she responds that he is making a scene, that these are his people, his group, that she doesn&rsquo;t care what they think of her, but he cares what they think of him. She then pushes past her, and he follows after her, saying &ldquo;Beatriz&rdquo;, one of his associates sees him on the way out, so he says hello without slowing down.</p>
<p>She is moving at a rapid clip down the street when he catches up to her and says that she has to talk to him, she can&rsquo;t leave. They can go back in and sit down and work everything out. She says, back in there, why? So he can reject and humiliate and ignore her again, because he is ashamed to be seen with her? He says that she shouldn&rsquo;t say that, it isn&rsquo;t true, she insists that it is. He insists that she is behaving disgracefully, and she says, how, because I am going around with two guys? He says, so then its over, we&rsquo;re finished? She says, unless you are willing to share me, because I am inclined to share myself. That&rsquo;s just the kind of woman I am.</p>
<p>He backs off and says, okay, so I made a mistake, I made a mistake, but this situation is making me crazy. You were teasing me in there, teasing and tempting me to kiss you, I need to kiss you. He grabs her and tries to kiss her, and she pulls away, and says no. He says I am dying to kiss you, dying, and he reaches for her again, stealing a brief kiss. No, she says, are you crazy. Yes, he responds, crazy for you, and I am going to kiss you. She says no, don&rsquo;t do it, and turns her head away. He grasps her chin and pulls her face towards his, firmly, and kisses her. She resists a little at first, then gives in. When they break, she pulls away and he tells her that he will make her forget Nicholas, he deserves her more because he loves and desires her, and kisses her again, but this time she doesn&rsquo;t respond. He pulls away and asks what is wrong, and she replies that she has to go. He says where? She says home. She turns and runs to catch a taxi, and waves goodbye - -Goodnight Doctor. Beatriz, wait, and he is standing next to her and shutting the door to prevent her from getting in, and he leans into her space. Don&rsquo;t get in, stay with me, we can go somewhere, somewhere where we can be alone, where I can show you how much I love and desire you. Where we can spend the night, the whole night together. She says that she has to go. He says, didn&rsquo;t you hear what I said? She responds, yes, Doctor, I heard you, and looking him directly in the eye, adds, but I don&rsquo;t want to be with you, I don&rsquo;t desire you. He releases her and she gets in the taxi and leaves.</p>
<p>Patty and Nicholas are receiving various plates of food, and as each one comes, Nicholas asks what it is, and the waiter says, it is what they ordered. The first plate (either oysters or scallops on the ½ shell, I forget which), floors him, and Patricia holds one of the ½ shells up for him to take. She is reaching for a fork, when he slups it directly out of the shell. This is the beginning of the end. Then the rest of the meal comes, I forget what it was, but Nicholas doesn&rsquo;t recognize this either, and asks what it is. Then, when he realizes that this is the main course, and is dismayed because, on par with most expensive restaurants, there is not much food on the plate, and he is hungry. He then proceeds to order lots of more filling dishes, including fried potatoes(I think). Patty is trying not to laugh at him, while feeling horrified at the same time. And he keeps referring to the waiter as joven, even though the waiter is probably older than he is. He also snaps his fingers and waves his hand around a lot in an affected, in charge manner.</p>
<p>Nicholas asks Patty if she lives with her mother, her father, a friend, or (gulp of discomfort) her boyfriend. She responds that she lives alone. She turns the question on him, and he responds that he too lives alone, but we see his squirm of discomfort, and we are reminded that he lives with his mother.</p>
<p>Patty then asks if Niki and Betty are going to get married, and he responds no, gosh no. She says that they seem very attached, and he responds no, not at all, it is a very independent relationship. She says that they must be very much in love, though, because he is so attentive and calls her all the time, gives her detalles, and lends her his car. He responds that a man doesn&rsquo;t have to be in love to do that, and she says no? (You can see the calculator working in her brain).</p>
<p>She tries to finagle the car, but Niki says he couldn&rsquo;t possibly, because he promised it to Betty. Patty then tries to secure his help in getting her car out of lockup, going on and on about how the embargo was a matter of bad luck. Niki alludes to being able to help her with that without promising anything. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can find a way to help.&rdquo; Patty - - Really, oh, how nice, I am so glad I met you. A toast to us!</p>
<p>Betty comes in the door, trying to tiptoe in, and is ambushed by her father in the blanket. He gives her the usual questions about how she got home, she says in taxi but accompanied. He asks if she talked to Armando about the car, and she replies yes, and that he is fine with everything. Armando has returned to the bar/club where they were. When the waiter asks if he wants the bill, he says no, a whisky. The musicians are singing &ldquo;te amo&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bill comes, and Nicholas pulls out a big wad of bills, and begins to count them - - he doesn&rsquo;t know how much he has, but it isn&rsquo;t going to be enough. He then pulls out the Terra Moda Checkbook, and starts writing, after a big show about the risks of taking checks, and toying with the waiter by pulling it back and forth out of his reach. Patty asks why he doesn&rsquo;t use credit, and he says, no credit is very bad - - the bills. Patty makes faces (we know she was hoping for access).</p>
<p>They come out of the restaurant and Niki tells the attendant to open the door for her, and that his tip is inside with the check he wrote to the restaurant.</p>
<p>Betty is in her room, writing in her diary. She can&rsquo;t believe she let Nicholas talk her into staying, she thought to get revenge, but it was a disaster, a disaster. Armando is sitting in the bar, drinking alone, listening to another song, the band is singing &ldquo;I miss you, I want that you had stayed with me.&rdquo; Betty is talking in the voiceover about how painful it is to know that he finds her repulsive, and he is touching his mouth, as if it were marked. Betty says he must be hurting for fear of his company the way she is hurting from his deception. He takes another sip, then jabs his fingers at his hair in frustration. She talks about how by now, he must be erasing all feeling of her, all memory of her with Marcela, and how she must avoid the temptation of being with him. Marcela calls, and asks what he is doing, and he replies that he is having a drink with a friend (male) and he will go back to his apartment after they are done. A friend says good night, and there are beautiful women everywhere, but he continues to drink alone. It was only her anger with him, at his reference to Nicholas being less, having less worth than he, that allowed her to pull back, and from now on she will have to keep her distance, because his skin, his kisses tempt her. She will have to keep her distance, until she can distance herself forever.</p>
<p>When Nicholas and Patty arrive at her home, she invites him up. You can tell he is tempted, but hesitates, and she says, oh, no, of course, and goes on and on about his relationship with Betty and how she respects that. She then hops out of the car (he looks like she hit him over the head) and gives a little wave. He calls after her, wait, wait, but she continues to walk away, and then turns back for another wave. After she is out of sight, he fawns all over the seat she sat in, touching it, even smelling it (the bottom of the seat no less!!!!)</p>
<p>It is morning and Don Hermes is complaining about not all of the skin being off of the papaya, and Dona Julia is rolling her eyes. Betty comes down, and Hermes starts in again about the car, and how even if Armando said it was okay, they shouldn&rsquo;t get too caught up, and Nicholas is turning into an idiot over the car and the clothes, and they shouldn&rsquo;t be confused about who they really were. Betty then opens the cupboard and shock! The checkbook and $$ from TerraModa are missing! She then thinks, ok, Niki probably moved them. Niki then shows up, after making lots of noise, and sits down at the table , giving Dona Julia &ldquo;his usual order&rdquo; and making lots of show. Hermes says that this is exactly what he was talking about, that they are both getting very caught up in all of this, and it needs to stop!</p>
<p>At Betty&rsquo;s HouseHermes tells Julia to stop being an &ldquo;alcagüeta&rdquo; and tells her that if breakfast is in process. She says yes and they both are out of the dining room. Betty aks Nico if he has the cheks and the money of the petty cash box. And he says he has been carrying it around with him just in case. She tells him that he should not do that. Nico tells her that they should get a credit card and he convinces her to request one from the Montreal bank. They both go out to the car because Nico will take Betty to work.</p>
<p>Armando is writing the &ldquo;detalle&rdquo; of the day . Mario comes in and asks that if &ldquo;we&rdquo; are ok with Betty (I noticed Mario always does that we thing). Armando aswers that better than before. Mario asks if he took her to the place he told him to. He says no, that he took her to &ldquo;el meson de san diego&rdquo;. Mario reacts shocked. And Armando tells that not only was he with her but that EVERYONE was there and he mentions a lot of names one of them Monica G.</p>
<p>Marcela is talking in the cell phone with MONICA G. And Marcela is repeating everything she says because we cannot hear Monica. And she says that Armando was with another woman. Apparently she describes Betty and she said she was really &ldquo;cariñosa&rdquo; (sorry bad english) with Armando. Marce says good bye and hangs up.</p>
<p>Armando explans with a lot of details what happened at &ldquo;el Meson&rdquo; and that Betty wanted him to kiss him A LOT. Mario asks him if he did and he says no and Mario reacts happy that Armando still had some sense. They also talk about how he tried to raise her salary and that they had to only use a certain amount of money per month. He also told them that el Muelon (that is how he called Nico) and Betty had already had everythng planned.</p>
<p>Patty and Marce talk in that moment and el cuartel comes in and Patty knows that so she starts to talk loudly and says that she went out to the Le Noir and that they did not order champagne like people who want to get noticed or they were not all crazy because they had earned a few bucks to go there and she tells her what they ate. Marce tells her that how could she have done something like that in front of them and to go with her to her office.</p>
<p>Berta starts saying that she would have done the same if someone had done what they did of showing off with Betty&rsquo;s boyfriend and going to lunch to the Le Noir. But el cuartel says that now how are they going to put up with Patty now. They decide to make a meeting of the cuartel to find out if Patty is telling the truth (about going to Le Noir the night before).</p>
<p>Mario is saying that Betty is trying to put Armando to the test for what he is doing to her. Armando corrects him and says &ldquo;what we are doing&rdquo;. Armando tells him about the call to Nicolas and Betty telling him to kiss him after and Mario tells him that if he kissed her and he said yes and that he felt she loved him but that she did not want to sleep with him that she told him that she did not want him. Mario went crazy he said that how could she do that, he would have strangled, killed, kicked her out, then he said no, no, we need her. And Mario tells him that if he has the Detalle of the day. Armando shows him the card he&rsquo;s written. Mario reads the card and he makes like 4 ahhs and then said why didn&rsquo;t you go to the writers meeting of something (not sure). HE is going out when he says maybe Nicolas did you a favor &hellip; maybe Nicolas is better endowed than you. Armando almost hit him.</p>
<p>Betty just got to Ecomoda and el cuartel tells her that they have a meeting at their meeeting place.</p>
<p>Patty talks about how they went in the Mercedes and that Betty probably walked. Marce said no, that Armando took care of her by taking her to el Meson de San Diego. Patty is speechless. Marce tells Patty how Monica told her that Betty was really cariñosa to Armando. Freddy comes in gives them the wedding invitations. Patty is telling Marce what an embarrasing night she had at the Le Noir . She told her about the food, the checks and the rubber stamps (everything stupid Nicolas did).</p>
<p>Betty comes in to Armando&rsquo;s office and she says sorry she did not know he will be in Ecomoda that early. He says its ok and that if she slept well she said yes and comes in to her office. She reads Armando&rsquo;s letter and Armando come in he tells her keep on reading and then when she is done he expects an answer. She says it&rsquo;s beatiful like always, thank you. He says that he is not here for her to thank her but to explain why she left yesterday and that if they are back again like before. The phone rings and Armando would not answer until Betty told him. Betty says yes like before and she answers. It&rsquo;s Roberto (Armando&rsquo;s father). Armando talks to him and when they start talking about the wedding Betty goes out of her office.</p>
<p>These scenes went back and forth but I will just put in one.</p>
<p>Marce tells Patty why did he take her to the Le Noir if he has no class. That they knew that anyone that coukd date Betty had to have something wrong. She says that she knows but she was not going to go out to an ugly place. Marce says that not to lie that the only reason Patty went out to the Le Noir is to get back at the cuartel. Daniel calls and says that he is coming to Ecomoda and Patty leaves.</p>
<p>El cuartel talks about how they can find out if Patty really went to the Le Noir and they decide to call the Le Noir and ask. Betty does not agree but at the end she did not say anything. El cuartel tells Berta to do it.</p>
<p>Patty calls Nico and tells him to call her in 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Armando is talking to his mom and he says that Marcela and him are only having a civil wedding ceremony (meaning not religious).</p>
<p>Armando tells Betty that now that they are ok that she should work on the report. That she has to cover up the real figures very well. She says yes but that if he is really going to cancel his wedding he says yes after the meeting. She agrees to cover up the real figures and then Armando is going to walk out and returns and tells her that he loves her and she says it back. Neither looks as if one another&rsquo;s actions convinces them. Betty lights up the candle.</p>

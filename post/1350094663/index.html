<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-10-12 21:59:18</p>
<p>We are live on tape from San Jose, California and your announcers are Josh ‘Drop the Puck Already’ Mathews and John ‘Man Mountain Rock’ Layfield.</p>
<p>We see footage of the attack by Alberto Del Rio on Randy Orton two weeks ago after Smackdown.</p>
<p>Josh mentions that Randy Orton is looking for Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>Alberto is in the locker room with Ricardo Rodriguez. Alberto wants to know what Ricardo is doing. Ricardo brings up the rumors and Alberto says that he does not care with he said on Twitter. Remember what he did in the past and what Big Show did to Orton. Alberto tells Ricardo if he is so worried about Orton, he should go out and find him.</p>
<p>Ricardo is hesitant but he leaves the room and we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Ricardo is looking in the back and he does not look too confident. He asks if anyone has seen Orton. Ricardo continues to walk and he is stopped by a snake and Ricardo is afraid. It is not a Viper, it is a Cobra. Santino asks Ricardo if he is afraid of snakes. Ricardo says that he isn’t but Santino tells him that he should be afraid of the Cobra and the Viper.</p>
<p>Ricardo walks away after being attacked by the Cobra.</p>
<p>Ricardo Rodriguez continues his search for Randy Orton and he is sent down another hallway. Ricardo hears what sounds like Orton, but he storms into a dressing room and it is Hornswoggle with a Randy Orton Brawling Buddy. Ricardo beats up the action figure and leaves.</p>
<p>Ricardo is telling Alberto that he knows that Randy Orton is here. Ricardo hides behind Del Rio and Daniel Bryan enters. Bryan asks if they were expecting someone else. Alberto says that they were expecting a snake, not a goat.</p>
<p>Daniel says that if he is a goat, he is the Greatest of All Time and he Am the Tag Team Champions.</p>
<p>Alberto says that Daniel is the tag team champions because of Kane.</p>
<p>Daniel tells Alberto that he is talking to him because Randy Orton has not found Del Rio yet.</p>
<p>Daniel tells Alberto that they have a match tonight. We will find out who the real G.O.A.T. in WWE is. Daniel reminds Alberto and Ricardo that he am the tag team champions.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Six: Daniel Bryan versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez)</strong></p>
<p>They lock up and Del Rio with a kick instead of a clean break. Bryan with kicks to the leg followed by a European uppercut or two. Bryan with a snap mare and kick to the back for a near fall. Del Rio sends Bryan into the corner and he kicks Bryan and chokes him in the corner.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a suplex and he floats over for a near fall. Del Rio with an Irish whip but Bryan moves when Del Rio charges into the corner. Bryan with kicks of no in the corner and around the ring. Bryan drives Del Rio’s knees into the mat and he gets a near fall. Bryan with another European uppercut.</p>
<p>Del Rio with kicks but Bryan with a punch and kicks to the midsection. Bryan flips over Del Rio in the corner and then he hits a flying clothesline. Bryan sets for the kicks of No to the chest. Bryan with a running kick to the midsection and then he sets for the running drop kick into the corner but Del Rio moves and Bryan hits the mat hard.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a step up enzuigiri to the shoulder. Del Rio wraps Bryan’s arm in the ropes as he sets up for the cross arm breaker. Del Rio misses a splash into the ropes but he holds on to the ropes. Bryan with kicks to the chest and Del Rio goes to the floor.</p>
<p>Bryan misses a running knee off the apron and Del Rio sends Bryan shoulder first into the ringside barrier as we go to commercial.</p>
<p>Bryan with a kick to Del Rio as he tries to get feeling back into his arm. Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker for a near fall. Del Rio with a kick to the arm and he applies a key lock. Bryan gets to his feet and he punches Del Rio in the midsection. Del Rio tries for another tilt-a-whirl back breaker but Bryan lands on his feet. Bryan tries for a round kick but Del Rio ducks it.</p>
<p>Del Rio tries for the float over into the cross arm breaker but Bryan avoids it and Bryan tries to lock in the No Lock but Ricardo gets on the apron and distracts the referee. Bryan is able to apply the hold but Del Rio crawls to the ropes as Ricardo tries to help by moving the rope closer. Del Rio gets his finger tip on the rope and Bryan releases the hold.</p>
<p>Del Rio goes to the apron and he applies a cross arm breaker in the ropes and the referee tells Del Rio to release the hold. Del Rio sends Bryan shoulder first into the ring post and then he floats over into the cross arm breaker and Bryan has to tap out.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>After the match, Del Rio celebrates in the ring and he has his arm raised by the referee.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he heard the rumors and the talking. The social media is messing with you because Randy Orton will not show up tonight. He says that we will see why he is not showing up tonight.</p>
<p>We see the footage from two weeks ago, one more time. We then see the footage from Orton’s match against Big Show on Main Event.</p>
<p>Del Rio says that Randy Orton is not a viper. He is not the apex predator because Alberto Del Rio is the new apex predator in the WWE. Orton is nothing but a slimy garden snake with no cajones to show his face tonight. Randy made the right decision to hide in the shadows like a little girl.</p>
<p>If Orton was here, he would give Randy a piece of his own medicine. Del Rio does the Orton pose. Del Rio then does the twist into the mat and he sees Randy Orton a few inches away from him. Orton grabs Del Rio and connects with forearms and kicks to the ribs. Orton sends Del Rio into the announce table and then connects with a European uppercut. Del Rio is sent into the ring post. Orton sends Del Rio into the ring steps and then Randy rearranges the announce table.</p>
<p>Orton puts Del Rio on the announce table and sets for the IEDDT off the table but Ricardo jumps on Orton’s back.</p>
<p>Del Rio goes up the ramp but Orton knows that Ricardo is at ringside and on the announce table. Orton slams Ricardo’s head into the announce table and then Orton hits an RKO on Ricardo onto the table.</p>

<p><strong>411&rsquo;s Instant Analysis 05.04.12: WWE SmackDown</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Michael Ornelas on 05.04.2012</p>
<p>We get Bryan vs. Sheamus TWICE in one night, a fun tag match between Orton &amp; Big Show and Kane &amp; Rhodes, the &ldquo;debut&rdquo; of Damien Sandow, and Teddy oiling up Cesaro&rsquo;s manly chest. Okay, so not everything was great, but most of it was!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s finals week at the University of Texas, I&rsquo;m graduating in a little over a week, moving to Los Angeles in two, and I have one final episode of Shenanigans to put out (an hour long finale). In other words, I&rsquo;m busy as hell. I&rsquo;ve relinquished the Contentious Ten for a few weeks until I&rsquo;m settled into my new apartment in L.A., and am not yet sure if I&rsquo;ll get to this every week either. That said, I did it this week, so here we go.</p>
<p>After that promo, Bryan came out and we got a rematch between the two that allowed Bryan to look absolutely tenacious against the Great White. The arm work looked convincing (as always when Bryan targets a limb). As always, I want Bryan&rsquo;s TV matches to go longer, but I&rsquo;m now getting on the &ldquo;I want Sheamus&rsquo; matches to go longer&rdquo; bandwagon as well. He&rsquo;s been very impressive in the ring over the past year, quietly improving, and he&rsquo;s finally at a point where he can shine. It&rsquo;s a shame they ended the match the way they did, but they didn&rsquo;t punk Bryan out (no pun intended) because he has a WWE Championship match at the next PPV. It&rsquo;s also very clever heel booking to transition to Alberto Del Rio as challenger as both he and Bryan work over Sheamus&rsquo;s arm. It gives him no time to recover and a larger obstacle in the path of the protagonist leads to a greater triumph.</p>
<p>Match Result: Sheamus beat Daniel Bryan by disqualification<br>
Match Length: Three minutes<br>
Rating: 7.5 out of 10</p>
<p>SEGMENT FOUR: Backstage with Eve, Danny, and Al</p>
<p>Bryan and Del Rio argued over Del Rio&rsquo;s involvement at the start of the show, and naturally Del Rio was lobbying for only himself to Eve. Bryan tried to take control and demand a rematch with Sheamus, but then Eve was all &ldquo;oh, I make the decisions around here, not you. And I&rsquo;m taller than you&rdquo; (it was in her body language, not her words) and Bryan backed off. Eve&rsquo;s actually excelling in this role she&rsquo;s playing and this little nugget was surprisingly enjoyable.</p>
<p>Rating: 6.0 out of 10</p>
<p>SEGMENT TEN: Daniel Bryan vs. Sheamus: Take Two</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never going to complain about this match-up, even if it&rsquo;s the second time in a night. Sheamus came out as the fighting champion, but his injury caught up with him quickly and Bryan was on him like an attack dog. Bryan has really found a style that negates the size problem that he faces against Sheamus and in the WWE in general. He was able to control the champ for several minutes. Why wasn&rsquo;t he allowed to wrestle like this when he was the World Heavyweight Champion? He got to shine, but they booked him against Henry and Show so much that it would have been unrealistic. Sheamus was great in his selling here. Big props to Bryan for his yelling &ldquo;hit me!&rdquo; at the wounded Celtic warrior. I would have never guessed that Sheamus would have been booked to have a &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; win against Bryan, but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt Sheamus any and gives Bryan some needed credibility. This was a fantastic main event and easily the best part of the show in my opinion. That Brogue Kick spot that ended the match was sick.</p>
<p>Match Result: Sheamus pinned Daniel Bryan<br>
Match Length: Ten minutes shown<br>
Rating: 9.0 out of 10</p>

<p><strong>411&rsquo;s WWE SmackDown Report 05.04.12</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Colin Rinehart on 05.04.2012</p>
<p>Sheamus beat Daniel Bryan not once, but twice while Randy Orton and the Big Show fought Kane and Cody Rhodes in tag team action and Damien Sandow made his debut! Check out 411&rsquo;s WWE Smackdown report for all the details!</p>
<p>WWE Friday Night SmackDown<br>
May 4th, 2012<br>
Huntington Center, Toledo, Ohio<br>
Attendance: Unknown at this time</p>
<p>Welcome back everyone to another edition of 411&rsquo;s WWE Smackdown report from yours truly. We&rsquo;re only five days removed from the Extreme Rules PPV and the colossal encounter that was Brock Lesnar vs. John Cena, but there&rsquo;s no time to rest as we&rsquo;re already only a few weeks away from the next PPV, Over the Limit. Tonight&rsquo;s show looks to be a solid one on paper with an Extreme Rules rematch between Sheamus and Daniel Bryan being advertised, so let&rsquo;s jump right into the thick of things and hope tonight&rsquo;s show is better than that dreadful RAW earlier this week.</p>
<p>Sheamus (30-15-1) vs. Daniel Bryan (15-19-2)<br>
Sheamus goes for a shoulder-block at the bell but starts favoring his arm, selling the injury from the Extreme Rules match (big points to Sheamus there). Bryan hits a drop-toe hold and tries for a wristlock but Sheamus just socks him in the jaw. Bryan comes back with a big armbreaker though and then stomps away at the Irishman in the corner. Sheamus drives his shoulder into Bryan&rsquo;s stomach in the corner and then clotheslines him out of the ring when all of a sudden Ricardo Rodriguez leaps into the ring and takes out Sheamus off the top rope with a cross-body to draw the DQ at 2:49. Del Rio hops in to give Sheamus the cross armbar afterwards and then Bryan gives him the YES! Lock as well to work over the injured arm even further. Well that wasn&rsquo;t much of a rematch, but it started off very good before the run-in. Hopefully this isn&rsquo;t the last we&rsquo;ve seen of these two tonight though. *1/2</p>
<p>Backstage Eve breaks up an arguing Daniel Bryan and Alberto Del Rio. Bryan says he would have beaten Sheamus if Del Rio didn&rsquo;t interfere but Del Rio doesn&rsquo;t care since he&rsquo;s the number one contender for the WHC. Bryan demands that he and Sheamus wrestle again tonight, and Eve tells him that she&rsquo;ll decide if they wrestle again after talking to the doctors.</p>
<p>Sheamus (31-15-1) vs. Daniel Bryan (15-20-2)<br>
Alberto Del Rio comes out to join the commentary team before the match starts. Bryan goes right to work on the injured shoulder of Sheamus (now taped up) with kicks. Nasty shoulder-breaker from Bryan, but Sheamus counters with a big tilt-a-whirl slam. He tries for the Brogue Kick but Bryan avoids it and sends Sheamus out of the ring as we take our last commercial break. When we return Bryan is diving onto the shoulder of Sheamus outside the ring. Sheamus tries to return to the ring but Bryan sends him back out again and then sends him shoulder-first into the steel post. Back in the ring Bryan hits the diving headbutt off the top rope for a two count. Bryan manages to unwrap most of the bandages on the shoulder, but Sheamus sends him shoulder-first into the steel post in a taste of his own medicine. Sheamus rips off the bandages like a badass and then lays in the ten hammer-fist forearms on Bryan in-between the ropes not once, but twice, leaving Daniel&rsquo;s chest beet red. Sheamus suplexes Bryan back into the ring, but Bryan kicks out of the pin. Bryan hits a knee but Sheamus hits the Irish Curse backbreaker in response and then begins kneeing the ever loving bejesus out of Bryan on the apron. Bryan drapes the injured shoulder over the top rope and hits the missile dropkick from the top, but now it&rsquo;s Sheamus&rsquo; turn to kick out. Bryan continues the shoulder-work but Sheamus lariats him inside-out 360 degrees in one of the sickest damn clotheslines I think I&rsquo;ve ever seen, that was downright Hansen-esque. Del Rio hits the apron but Sheamus sends Bryan into him to bump him off the apron. Bryan tries for another missile dropkick from the top, but Sheamus BOOTS HIS HEAD OFF with the Brogue Kick for the win at 9:27 (shown). I was already digging this quite a bit but by the last few minutes Sheamus was just murdering Bryan and he was taking all the bumps like a champ as they just kicked this one into overdrive for the finish. This feud continues to be awesome when they actually give them time to wrestle, what a shocker. Great TV match. ***1/4</p>
<p>We close out the show with Sheamus celebrating in the ring as Bryan lays dead and Del Rio storms off up the ramp with Rodriguez.</p>

<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: WHICH FAMILY IS BEST IN THE RING; CAN DEL RIO CHARM VICKIE?; THE MAGIC NUMBER IS SIX; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-10-11 22:00:22</p>
<p>In case you missed Battleground or Raw, we take a look back at what Big Show did on Sunday and what Stephanie McMahon did to Big Show on Monday. Then we see what happened to Triple H at the end of the night.</p>
<p>We are in Columbus, Ohio and your announcers are John ‘Buckeye’ Layfield and Michael ‘Blue Jacket’ Cole.</p>
<p>Vickie Guerrero comes to the ring and we see Alberto Del Rio doing his best to suck up to Vickie on Raw and Vickie rejecting his advances when he turned his back. Then we see the announcement that Alberto will be facing John Cena at Hell in a Cell.</p>
<p>Vickie says on Raw everyone witnessed the most heinous atrocity in the history of the WWE. The COO of the WWE was struck by the Big Show. The Big Show tried to compromise the main event of Battleground. He should have been fired a long time ago.</p>
<p>While all of you thought the situation was hilarious, the problems for the Big Show have just begun. There is a For Sale sign in front of Big Show’s house and he is unemployed. Big Show deserves . . .</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio interrupts Vickie and he comes to the ring. Alberto asks Vickie to reconsider. He does not want to have to defend the title against John Cena.</p>
<p>Vickie tells Alberto that him versus John Cena is what is best for business. The name of the pay per view is Hell in a Cell.</p>
<p>Alberto says that this is not fair. There has got to be something to make Vickie change her mind.</p>
<p>Vickie thinks about it. She asks Alberto if it was true what he said about her when he said she was sexy?</p>
<p>Alberto says every single word he said was true.</p>
<p>Vickie tells Alberto if he wants her to reconsider, she tells Alberto to kiss her.</p>
<p>Alberto kisses Vickie on the cheek but Vickie wants him to kiss her on the lips. Alberto hesitates but he does what Vickie wants. Vickie tells Alberto to put a little something into the kiss. Alberto puts a little more passion into the kiss.</p>
<p>Vickie tells Alberto to do it like the French. Maybe he can kiss her some other place, like her rear end (as Vickie points to her rear end). She says that she will not reconsider.</p>
<p>Damien Sandow’s music plays and he makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Damien says that he interrupts this matter for some breaking news. Alberto Del Rio is a phony. Damien tells Vickie that Alberto sees her as a sex object that he thinks he can manipulate. Damien says that Vickie is beautiful but he appreciates her intelligence. Alberto is out here begging not to be put in a match with John Cena because he knows that he will lose. Just like he would beg Vickie not to let him cash in his Money in the Bank contract.</p>
<p>Alberto’s conduct and mere presence in the ring is not befitting of a champion. Damien will show that he is the better man when given the opportunity.</p>
<p>Vickie says that he wondered what would happen when these two men face off in the ring. Damien will not have to cash in his briefcase and Alberto will not have to put the title on the line.</p>
<p>Alberto hits Sandow with the mic and he attacks Sandow. Sandow runs Alberto into the corner and then he grabs his case and Del Rio leaves the ring.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Four: Alberto Del Rio versus Damien Sandow in a Non Title Match</strong></p>
<p>Sandow with a kick and forearm. He sends Del Rio into the turnbuckles as they go around the ring. Sandow with shoulders in the corner and Del Rio gets to the floor. Sandow follows after Del Rio but Del Rio gets into the ring first and he kicks Sandow. Del Rio with a snap mare and kick to the back. Del Rio gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a reverse chin lock on Sandow but Sandow with elbows to get out of the hold. Del Rio with head butts. Sandow with a hip toss and he punches Del Rio. Del Rio grabs his title belt and he walks away.</p>
<p>Sandow follows and he hits Del Rio from behind. Sandow sends Del Rio into the apron and then he Irish whips Del Rio into the apron. They return to the ring and Sandow gets a near fall. Sandow runs his boot laces across the face. Del Rio runs Sandow into the turnbuckles. Del Rio with a savate kick followed by a drop kick and he gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a boot to the head and then he goes up top. Del Rio with a double sledge to Sandow and he gets a near fall. Sandow gets back to his feet and he connects with elbows but Del Rio with a knee. Del Rio sends Sandow into the turnbuckles and then he goes for the step up enzuigiri but Sandow back body drops Del Rio over the top rope to the floor.</p>
<p>Sandow sends Del Rio back into the ring and he connects with a knee drop and an elbow drop for a near fall. Sandow with a suplex and he gets a near fall. Sandow kicks Del Rio and the referee pulls Sandow out of the corner. Del Rio with a kick to Sandow and a kick to the back of the leg. Del Rio with punches to Sandow but Sandow punches back.</p>
<p>Sandow with head butts but he misses a charge into the corner and he hits the ring post with his shoulder and Del Rio turns his focus to the arm and he kicks it. Sandow with a kick and a clothesline that sends Del Rio over the top rope to the floor.</p>
<p>| Sandow tells everyone he is the uncrowned champ as we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Del Rio with a drop kick. Del Rio chokes Sandow in the ropes as the referee warns Alberto. Del Rio misses a splash against the ropes and Del Rio goes to the floor. Sandow tries to Irish whip Del Rio into the steps and Del Rio stops short and he hits a super kick.</p>
<p>They go into the ring and Del Rio and Sandow with punches. Del Rio with a head butt. Sandow with a back elbow and clothesline. Sandow with a slam and the Elbow of Disdain for a near fall. Sandow pulls down the knee pad and he misses a knee drop. Del Rio with a super kick for a near fall. Del Rio with kicks to the head.</p>
<p>Del Rio taunts Sandow but Sandow with a punch. Del Rio with a kick and an arm breaker. Del Rio signals for the cross arm breaker and he sets to float over but Sandow counters with an Edgecution but he can only get a near fall.</p>
<p>Sandow sets for Terminus but Del Rio counters with a lungblower for a near fall. Del Rio misses the step up enzuigiri and Sandow with a running snap neck breaker for a near fall. Del Rio goes to the apron but Sandow stops Alberto. Sandow kicks Del Rio and the referee pulls Sandow away. Del Rio with a kick to the knee and Del Rio applies a cross arm breaker and Sandow taps out.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>

<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: ROCK, PUNK, SHIELD; WHAT DOES BOOKER DO WHEN THERE ARE SIX MEN IN THE RING ABOUT TO FIGHT?; BARRETT/SHEAMUS REMATCH; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-01-25 21:54:32</p>
<p>It is the final significant show before the Royal Rumble and it is time to see who will make the final pitch to get into the Royal Rumble match. What will happen between Rock and CM Punk when they bring their WWE Title issues to the best wrestling show that is more than an hour in length. Will any new matches be announced for the pay per view? What about the final plans for the World Title Match between Alberto Del Rio and Big Show?</p>
<p>We are in Sacramento, California and your announcers are John ‘How great is Alberto Del Rio . . . he had Jason Barsky interview him’ Layfield and Josh ‘I am not Tough Enough to deal with Jason Barsky’ Mathews.</p>
<p>Kane and Daniel Bryan make their way to the ring but they are not going to wrestle yet, because this is Smackdown and they only talk about fighting at the start of the show.</p>
<p>We take a look back at the graduation ceremony for Kane and Daniel Bryan and the uber Hug Fest.</p>
<p>Kane says that they have come out here to address the rumors that started this week that they have gone soft because they have learned to channel their anger. Bryan says that nothing could be further from the truth. Kane tells everyone to watch the Royal Rumble. After they beat Damien Sandow and Cody Rhodes and retain the Tag Titles, Kane says that he will eliminate 29 others and win the Royal Rumble and go to Wrestlemania.</p>
<p>Daniel wants to make sure that he heard Kane right.</p>
<p>Kane reminds Daniel that he has been in thirteen Royal Rumbles and he has eliminated eleven men in one match.</p>
<p>Bryan points out that Kane has never won the Royal Rumble and then we get both men declaring that they will win the Royal Rumble Match.</p>
<p>Big Show’s music interrupts and he makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Show tells Daniel and Kane that no one cares about their plans. They have a one in thirty chance of winning the Royal Rumble while Show says that he has a one hundred percent chance of winning the World Title from Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>He tells them that the only plans that they should have if they win the Royal Rumble are retirement plans because they will never beat him at Wrestlemania.</p>
<p>Daniel Bryan reminds Show that he beat Show for the World Title already.</p>
<p>Show will not listen to any crap from Daniel Bryan. Show says that Del Rio stole the World Title from him. Del Rio snuck into the World Title picture like a cockroach scurrying across the border. On Sunday, he will squish that bug and if either of them don’t get out of his ring, he will squish them right now.</p>
<p>Kane tells Show they are not a couple of bugs. They are the tag team champions. They are not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Bryan translates for the WWE Universe and he says ‘No’ a few times.</p>
<p>Damien Sandow and Cody Rhodes make their way to the stage and then to the ring. Damien tells Kane and Daniel Bryan that they are making a critical error of putting the cart before the horse . . . or the goat. They should be more concerned with their tag title match on Sunday. Just as Goliath underestimated David, they are underestimating him and Cody. On Sunday, their destruction will be of biblical proportions.</p>
<p>Cody tells Damien that they are wasting their breath because of who they are talking to and in front of. Cody is going to simplify it for the simpletons. Damien clarifies that he is talking about the people. Cody says that they are going to take the Tag Titles.</p>
<p>Damien suggests an alliance with Big Show. Seeing how by this time next week, they will all be champions, why not make an example by destroying Daniel and Kane post haste.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio’s music plays and he makes his way to the ring with Ricardo Rodriguez.</p>
<p>All six men look like they are about to fight . . . that can only mean one thing. We are Condition Booker and Booker T’s music plays and he is confused at first because there are six men in the ring and how do you do a ‘standard’ tag match with six men?</p>
<p>Booker says that he appreciates their passion to fight because that is what we do on Smackdown. Booker suggests that they make this fight official. The main event will be Cody Rhodes, Damien Sandow, and Big Show against Daniel Bryan, Kane, and Alberto Del Rio. To add something to the mix, there will be a stipulation. It will be an elimination match.</p>
<p>Booker wants to know if we are ready to dig.</p>
<p>Cody and Damien go to the floor and Show goes after Del Rio but Del Rio with a drop toe hold. We have a stand off and Del Rio with a wink in Show’s direction.</p>
<p>Match Number Five: Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez), Daniel Bryan, and Kane versus Big Show, Cody Rhodes, and Damien Sandow in an Elimination Match</p>
<p>Del Rio and Rhodes start things off and they lock up. Cody works on the wrist but Del Rio reverses and he puts Cody in an arm bar. Rhodes with punches followed by an Irish whip but Del Rio with an elbow. Del Rio goes to the turnbuckles and he leaps over Rhodes and takes him down with a rana. Del Rio sends Cody into the air and then down to the mat. Del Rio with a kick.</p>
<p>Sandow tags in and so does Bryan. They lock up and Sandow with a snap mare but Bryan with a drop toe hold that sends Sandow into the turnbuckles. Bryan with kicks of no in the corner. Bryan with a snap mare and Kane is tagged in and Kane with a drop kick to Sandow. Rhodes distracts Kane long enough to allow Sandow to hit a drop kick to the knee. Sandow with punches to Kane.</p>
<p>Kane grabs Sandow by the throat and he hits a choke slam and Sandow is eliminated.</p>
<p>Damien Sandow Eliminated</p>
<p>Big Show enters the match and Kane punches Show and connects with clotheslines. Kane with a DDT for a near fall and Kane goes to the apron. Kane goes up top for the clothesline and he hits it. Kane clotheslines Show over the top rope to the floor.</p>
<p>Kane charges at Show on the floor and Show with the punch and Kane is counted out.</p>
<p>Kane Eliminated</p>
<p>Cody tags in and he faces Daniel Bryan as we go to commercial.</p>
<p>Bryan with elbows to Cody but Cody with a knee to Bryan’s midsection and Cody gets a near fall. Cody stretches Bryan but Bryan gets to his feet and he kicks Cody. Both men go for a cross body but they collide and go to the mat.</p>
<p>Show tags in and he keeps Bryan from making the tag to Del Rio. Show grabs Bryan by the throat but Bryan with kicks of no. Bryan is pushed into the corner and Show with a running butt splash. Show sets for the running shoulder tackle but Bryan with a drop kick to the knee and Show goes down.</p>
<p>Bryan goes to the apron and then to the top turnbuckle but Show with a chop to the face as he comes down. Show sends Bryan over the top rope but Bryan skins the cat and then when Bryan gets back into the ring, Show with a knock out punch and Bryan is counted out.</p>
<p>Daniel Bryan Eliminated</p>
<p>Show wants Del Rio to get in the ring but Del Rio takes his time. Del Rio with a back heel kick and more kicks and punches. Show grabs Del Rio and hits a choke slam and Del Rio rolls to the floor. The referee makes his count and Del Rio gets back into the ring at nine. Del Rio rolls back to the floor and then Show goes to the floor. Del Rio with punches to Show but Show punches back.</p>
<p>They return to the ring and Del Rio kicks the ropes while Show climbs over. Del Rio with a round kick to the head followed by a super kick that sends Show to the floor. The referee makes his count and he gets to ten.</p>
<p>Big Show Eliminated</p>
<p>Cody with a rollup for a near fall followed by a drop kick. Cody with boots to Del Rio. Cody misses the Beautiful Disaster and Del Rio with clotheslines and a tilt-a-whirl back breaker. Del Rio with a super kick and he gets a near fall. Del Rio sets for the running step up enzuigiri and he hits it. Del Rio gets the three count.</p>
<p>Winners: Alberto Del Rio, Kane, and Daniel Bryan</p>
<p>After the match, while Alberto Del Rio celebrates his win, Big Show enters the ring and he spears Del Rio. Show tells the announcers to get up. Show picks up Del Rio and he punches Del Rio behind the announce table and then Show pushes the announce table onto Del Rio and he counts to ten.</p>

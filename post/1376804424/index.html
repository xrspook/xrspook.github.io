<p><strong>WWE Live Event Results From Portland, OR (8/16): Daniel Bryan Gets Title Shot, CM Punk, More</strong></p>
<p>By Raj Giri | August 17, 2013</p>
<p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader John McFarland for sending in these results from last night&rsquo;s WWE Live Supershow at the Rose Garden in Portland, OR:</p>
<p>The arena was about 75-80% sold out. The floor seats and most of the lower bleachers were full, but there were some mostly empty sections near the top of the middle bleachers. The top balcony was curtained off, as was the back 1/4th or so of the arena behind the entry ramp.</p>
<p>I sat in the fourth row, two seats over from the entry ramp, and had a great view of the ring and the ramp, but had to crane my neck up to see the big screen suspended in the air above the ring. The crowd was very excited before the show, with chants of &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;, &ldquo;RVD!&rdquo; &ldquo;CM Punk!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Woooo!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go Cena!/Cena sucks!&rdquo; sporadically breaking out as the arena filled up. Before the show started, a commercial was shown announcing that Smackdown will be taping at the Rose Garden (soon to be renamed the Moda Center) on December 10th, and that the presale password will be PORTLANDWWE.</p>
<p>After the national anthem was played, our ring announcer, Brad Maddox, entered to pretty solid booing, and cut a promo which was mostly booed (aside from some cheers when he talked about how great Portland is). He announced that John Cena would not be appearing as advertised due to his elbow injury and that refunds would be available for anyone who wanted to leave until the end of the second match. Since Cena was scheduled to face Alberto Del Rio in the main event, Maddox announces that the show will start with an eleven-man battle royale to determine who gets a title shot against Del Rio instead.</p>
<p>BATTLE ROYAL: Daniel Bryan, Dolph Ziggler, Rob Van Dam, Christian, Mark Henry, R-Truth, Ryback, Big E Langston, Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins</p>
<p>The competitors enter together along the ramp and step into the ring. Once the bell rings, most of them pair off and begin fighting one-on-one, except for the Shield who work as a unit and go 3-on-1 against Mark Henry, lifting him up together and eliminating him, followed by R-Truth and RVD. The Shield then toss Christian over the ropes - but he hangs on, grabs Ambrose, and takes him out eliminating him shortly before Ambrose and Reigns knock him back to the floor. Daniel Bryan eliminates Reigns shortly after, leaving Bryan, Ziggler, Rollins, and Ryback staring each other down. Rollins whispers something to Ryback, after which they high-five and team up to take on the other two. The alliance is short-lived, however, as Ryback soon throws both Rollins and Ziggler out of the ring almost at once. Ryback goes for a clothesline on Bryan and knocks him over the top rope, but Bryan takes Ryback with him, and they both end up on the apron holding on for dear life. Bryan finds his footing, kicks Ryback&rsquo;s hand until he lets go, and eliminates him.</p>
<p>WINNER: Daniel Bryan in 6:59</p>
<p>WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Daniel Bryan vs. Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>Del Rio enters to a mixed reaction, and takes and holds up an audience member&rsquo;s Del Rio sign. Bryan enters to a huge pop, with almost the entire audience chanting &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Bryan throws his shirt and towel into the crowd. Del Rio gestures as if to do the same, but instead just drops his shirt in Maddox&rsquo;s lap. The two go back and forth, with Bryan applying a surfboard to Del Rio before taking the fight outside and getting thrown into a steel post. Bryan and Del Rio trade blows in the center of the ring with the audience shouting &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; and &ldquo;No!&rdquo; with each blow, and a few people shouting &ldquo;Si!&rdquo; Bryan goes for a missile dropkick but misses, and Del Rio follows up with two backstabbers and several 2-counts. Del Rio grabs the microphone and cuts a promo mid-match, declaring that he&rsquo;s the champion and he&rsquo;s the best there is. Del Rio rolls down his kneepad and tries to hit Bryan in the face with its sheer edge, but Bryan dodges and rolls him up for a 2-count. Del Rio delivers a few more backstabbers and goes for the cross armbreaker, but Bryan counters and puts him in the Yes Lock. Del Rio inches towards the ropes, but instead of going for a rope break he grabs the microphone and bashes Bryan in the face with it, and the referee calls for the bell.</p>
<p>WINNER: Daniel Bryan (by DQ) in 14:08</p>
<p>Del Rio takes the microphone and stands over Bryan, declaring himself the winner and still world champion. Bryan grabs him and forces him back into a Yes-Lock, and Del Rio taps almost immediately. As Del Rio leaves the ring, Bryan takes the microphone and cuts a short promo, telling the audience that he grew up about 2 1/2 hours away from here in Aberdeen, WA, and that the next time he visits home he&rsquo;ll be doing so as WWE champion. Bryan&rsquo;s theme music plays and the crowd cheers as he makes his way along ringside and along both sides of the entry ramp high-fiving everyone (including me!) As the lights come back on, the audience is wished a good night and Fandango&rsquo;s theme song plays as the crowd files out.</p>
<p>OVERALL OPINION: 3.75 stars out of 5. WWE only does one or two shows a year in the Pacific Northwest, and they really pulled out all the stops for this one, with an all-star lineup and some really great matches. Cena&rsquo;s absence was a bit of a disappointment, but the battle royale and the main event made up for it. The six-man tag match stole the show and the ending took me by surprise, since the Shield lose so rarely and Reigns&rsquo; spear is almost always the death blow in every match he appears in. The R-Truth/Ryback match was basically filler, and the Kaitlyn/AJ match, despite some impressive acrobatics, was basically the same match they&rsquo;ve had on TV three or four times now. Kaitlyn&rsquo;s appearance was a welcome surprise, though, since she wasn&rsquo;t advertised for the show. (Antonio Cesaro, on the other hand, was advertised but did not appear, unless you count the Cesaro shirt Ziggler wore during the battle royale.) The crowd was very into the performance and cheered and booed enthusiastically, and even Brad Maddox wasn&rsquo;t half bad as ring announcer. In the end, it was a great three hours and well worth the price of ringside seats.</p>

<p><strong>Another Set Of Results From Last Night&rsquo;s WWE Live Event: Ryback Suffers Upset Loss, John Cena Absent</strong></p>
<p>By Raj Giri | August 17, 2013</p>
<p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader Owen Rey for sending in these results from last night&rsquo;s WWE live event in Portland, OR:</p>
<p>Brad Maddox started the show off by warming up to his hometown crowd, talking about how tonight will be the best show Portland has ever seen. However, he did tell us that John Cena would not be there due to injury. This got a whole lotta boos, although I didn&rsquo;t see anyone leave for their refund.</p>
<p>Battle Royal to face Alberto Del Rio for the WHC</p>
<p>Big E Langston, R-Truth, Mark Henry, The Shield, Christian, Ryback, Dolph Ziggler, Rob Van Dam, and Daniel Bryan came out. Big E was eliminated first, and it came down to a final four of Ziggler, Bryan, Rollins and Ryback. Ambrose got a ton of heat for eliminating RVD. Ryback offered an alliance to Rollins, who agreed. However, while Rollins was attempting to eliminate Bryan, Ryback snuck up and tossed Rollins over. Ryback then eliminated Ziggler. Ryback zoned in on Bryan, but Bryan reversed a powerbomb attempt into a hurricanrana over the top rope.</p>
<p>Winner: Daniel Bryan</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio vs. Daniel Bryan - WHC</p>
<p>Bryan worked the crowd really well, and Del Rio got a ton of heel heat. The match contained a lot of submissions, but spilled out to the outside for a little bit. The biggest spot was a suicide dive by Bryan, which was crazy to see. Del Rio controlled, but Bryan mounted a comeback. Del Rio hit a crazy backbreaker on Bryan, and then cut a promo on how the crowd should love him because he&rsquo;s the champion. This was followed by a small &lsquo;Si&rsquo; chant, but the match went on. Del Rio went for a CAB, but Bryan reversed it to the LaBell lock. Del Rio tried to get to the ropes, but ended up grabbing the mic (Not sure why it was still in the ring) and hit Bryan with it. After the match, Bryan put a LaBell Lock on Del Rio, who then quickly ran away.</p>
<p>Winner: Bryan by DQ</p>
<p>Bryan stayed to cut a promo, although it was very short. Bryan talked about how he grew up right next to here and when he comes back next it will be with the WWE Championship. He made a victory lap around the ring and high fived everyone around the ring.</p>
<p>Live Notes:</p>
<p>Maddox was ringside the entire time, as he was multitasking with GM and Ring Announcer duties.</p>
<p>The little kids were really disappointed when they found out Cena wouldn&rsquo;t be there, but they still had quite a bit of fun it seemed like.</p>
<p>I saw Orton and Sheamus around the arena in the concourse during intermission, although neither of them came out during the show. I was expecting Orton to interrupt the Main Event, although that never happened. I understand Sheamus not coming out though.</p>
<p>With this being my first wrestling show, I was shocked to see how interactive the wrestlers were. All the faces interacted around the ring and it was pretty fun. My personal highlight was Daniel Bryan coming up and high fiving me after his match.</p>

<p><strong>Second Set Of House Show Results 08.16.13: Portland, Oregon</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Joseph Lee on 08.17.2013</p>
<p>WWE Live</p>
<p>August 16, 2013</p>
<p>The show opened with Brad Maddox coming down to the ring, and informing the crowd that John Cena would not be at the event due to injury. The crowd responded with cheers. Maddox said that in order to find a new opponent for Alberto Del Rio (the advertised main event had been Del Rio Vs Cena) there would be a battle royal.</p>
<p>(1) Battle Royal</p>
<p>Participants: Christian, R-Truth, Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose, Rob Van Dam, Mark Henry, Dolph Ziggler, Big E Langston, Ryback, and Daniel Bryan.</p>
<p>The final four participants were Ryback, Rollins, Ziggler, and Bryan. Ryback and Rollins teamed up against Ziggler and Bryan. Rollins was eliminated, followed by Ziggler, and Bryan won when both he and Ryback went over the top. Bryan held on to the top rope and had to help Ryback get loose as his hand got stuck in between the ropes.</p>
<p>(8) World Heavyweight Championship Match</p>
<p>Daniel Bryan def. Alberto Del Rio via DQ</p>
<p>Match ended in DQ after Del Rio hit Bryan with a microphone when locked in the No Lock. After the match Bryan again put Del Rio into the submission to which Del Rio tapped. Bryan then grabbed the microphone and said how he grew with two and a half hours away from Portland, and how when they come back in December for Smackdown, he will be the WWE Champion.</p>

<p><strong>COMPLETE WWE ROYAL RUMBLE 2014 COVERAGE</strong></p>
<p>By Mike Johnson on 2014-01-26 19:53:00</p>
<p>Welcome to PWInsider.com&rsquo;s live, ongoing coverage of the 2014 Royal Rumble PPV from Pittsburgh, PA at the CONSOL Center!</p>
<p>They went to a backstage vignette where wrestlers were picking their numbers. Alberto Del Rio was really happy with his pick and said he would take everyone out. Kofi Kingston said his &ldquo;could be better.&rdquo; R-Truth wasn&rsquo;t happy at all with his. The Real Americans argued over who would go first. Of the two, Jack Swagger was happier with his pick. Great Khali wasn&rsquo;t happy at all. Damien Sandow mocked him, then apparently picked an even worse number. Khali laughed at him.</p>
<p><strong>THE ROYAL RUMBLE</strong></p>
<p>Punk was number one. Seth Rollins was number two. Punk went right after him and drove him into the corner. Rollins reversed that and tried to force Punk over the top. Punk raked his face and nailed a series of rights. Rollins cut him off but Punk kicked him. Rollins came back with a leg lariat and then a flying splash in the corner. Punk moved and Rollins hit the corner. Punk nailed the running knee into the corner and then a clothesline. Rollins came back with an enziguiri but was kicked down.</p>
<p>Number three was Damien Sandow. He went right after Punk and tried to force him over the top. Punk fought him off but Rollins attacked. The crowd chanted for Punk. He nailed a combination DDT and neckbreaker. Punk tried to toss Rollins over the top but couldn&rsquo;t get him over. Punk drilled him in the corner but was attacked from behind by Sandow.</p>
<p>Number four was Cody Rhodes. He charged the ring and exchanged punches with old foe Sandow. He nailed Crossrhodes on Sandow and struggled to pull him up to toss him out. Rollins attacked him from behind. Sandow tried to attack Punk but was backdropped over the top to the floor.</p>
<p>Sandow has been eliminated.</p>
<p>Punk worked over Rollins and Rhodes.</p>
<p>Number five was Kane as a surprise. He came out in his street clothes. What happened to him not being allowed to put his hands on WWE talents? He went right after Punk, whipping him into the corner and nailing a sideslam. He called for a chokeslam and went for it. Punk nailed a kick to the face and sent Kane over the to the floor.</p>
<p>Kane has been eliminated.</p>
<p>Number six is the debuting Alexander Rusev from NXT. No Lana with him. Rusev wiped out Rollins with a spinkick. He tossed Rollins over the top but he held on and pulled himself in. He then tossed Rhodes who did the same. Rusev caught Punk going for a kick and nailed him with a Fall Away Slam.</p>
<p>Number seven is Jack Swagger. He got some offense in and went face to face with Rusev. The crowd chanted &ldquo;USA&rdquo; and &ldquo;We the People.&rdquo; Rusev got the better of him. Rollins nailed Rusev from behind in the legs. They all battled.</p>
<p>Number eight was Kofi Kingston, who clotheslined Punk and tried to toss him out. Rusev battled with Rollins. Rhodes nailed the Disaster Kick on Swagger. Punk escaped and Kingston went after Rusev, who he&rsquo;s been battling in NXT. Rusev drilled him with headbutts. Swagger almost tossed Rollins over the top but he escaped and tried to toss Swagger.</p>
<p>Number nine was Jimmy Uso. Everyone battled. Punk tried to put a sleeper on Rusev while riding his back.</p>
<p>Number ten was Goldust who battled with Uso as everyone else worked on Rusev and finally forced him over the top to the floor.</p>
<p>Rusev has been eliminated.</p>
<p>Kingston was tossed over the top and knocked off the apron. Rusev caught him and beat him atop the guard rail, leaving him there for dead, but not eliminated. Kingston recovered and timed himself then leapt from the guard rail to the apron. That was damn impressive.</p>
<p>Number eleven was Dean Ambrose. He went right after Kingston. Goldust worked over Swagger. The battle continued.</p>
<p>Number twelve was the returning-from-concussion Dolph Ziggler. He nailed a flashy move on Ambrose. Everyone battled in the ring.</p>
<p>Number thirteen was R-Truth. He and Ambrose battled in the center of the ring. Rollins joined in and they put the boots to him and tossed him over the top. He held on and nailed Rollins but Ambrose knocked him off the apron into the ringside table. Ambrose them shoved Uso off the top to the floor.</p>
<p>R-Truth and Jimmy Uso have been eliminated.</p>
<p>Swagger tossed Kingston over the top but he held on. Swagger used his boot to try and force Kingston out. Kingston pulled his boot off, pulled himself up and nailed Swagger with his own boot.</p>
<p>Number 14 was Kevin Nash, coming out to the NWO theme song. I guess that pilot was for the WWE Network. He tossed Swagger out immediately.</p>
<p>Jack Swagger was been eliminated.</p>
<p>Nash went after Ambrose and tried to force him over. Punk battled with Rollins.</p>
<p>Number 15 was Roman Reigns. He dropkicked Punk as he leapt on the apron. He speared Cody and went right after Nash, naling him. Kingston leapt at him but was caught and dumped over the top to the floor. Ziggler nailed a nasty looking DDT but Reigns came back to spear Ziggler and tossed him out. The crowd booed Ziggler being tossed.</p>
<p>Nash went after Reigns but he ducked and pulled the ropes down. Nash went out.</p>
<p>Ziggler, Nash and Kingston were all eliminated.</p>
<p>Number 16 was Great Khali. Reigns drilled him with the Superman Punch and out he went.</p>
<p>Khali is eliminated.</p>
<p>Cody and Goldust were tossed.</p>
<p>The Shield was left with Punk and beat him down.</p>
<p>Number 17 was the returning Sheamus, who cleaned house on all three members of The Shield. Sheamus beat Ambrose across the chest as he was trapped in the ropes. Rollins charged him but was caught with The Irish Curse. Reigns charged but was drilled with a big boot. Punk was out in the corner during all of this.</p>
<p>Number 18 was The Miz. Miz went right after Ambrose and tossed him over but Ambrose held on. The Shield warmed Miz and Sheamus. Punk was still out in the corner.</p>
<p>Number 19 was Fandango. Everyone was doing the song. He worked over Miz. Rollins and Reigns worked over Sheamus and Punk. The crowd chanted for Daniel Bryan.</p>
<p>Instead, number 20 came out and it was&hellip;El Torito. He nailed a springboard rana on Rollins. He called out Punk and charged but Punk grabbed his head by his his hand. Torito turned it into a headscissors takeover. Fandango wiped out Torito and pressed him over his head. Torito used a takeover to send Fandango over the top to the apron. Torito dropkicked him to the floor. Reigns grabbed Torito and tossed him out to the floor on top of Fandango.</p>
<p>Torito and Fandango have been eliminated.</p>
<p>Number 21 was Antonio Cesaro. He grabbed Miz and did the Big Swing and Punk dropkicked him as he swung Miz towards him. Cesaro went to nail Punk with it but was attacked by The Shield. He fought them off and gave Rollins a swing 22 times.</p>
<p>Number 22 was Luke Harper. Cesaro was speared by Reigns. Punk and Harper slugged it out. Ambrose tried to use a headscissor takedown on Sheamus who went over but held on. Harper clotheslined Punk hard. Sheamus and Harper exchanged blows. Everyone battled.</p>
<p>Number 23 was Jey Uso. Everyone battled. Cesaro and Harper exchanged blows. Harper nailed a big boot on the Swiss star.</p>
<p>Number 24 was JBL. He left the announcer position. Cole said the &ldquo;JBL character&rdquo; has never competed in the Rumble match. JBL entered the ring in his suit. He asked Cole to take his jacket. Reigns grabbed him and dumped him. Well, that was a waste.</p>
<p>JBL has been eliminated.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t have put Curt Hawkins or Zack Ryder in there for that?</p>
<p>The crowd chanted, &ldquo;You still got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number 25 was Eric Rowan. He tossed Miz over but he held on. Harper nailed a lariat to Miz on the apron and that was it for the former WWE champ.</p>
<p>Miz has been eliminated.</p>
<p>The Wyatts tossed Jey Uso.</p>
<p>Jey Uso has been eliminated.</p>
<p>Number 26 was Ryback. He went right after Sheamus. Lots of Goldberg chants. He almost dumped Sheamus over. Rollins almost went over but held on. Cesaro and Sheamus battled in the center of the ring. They had some nice, stiff exchanges. Punk battled with Rollins. Reigns battled with Harper. Rowan with Ambrose. Ryback stalked the ring.</p>
<p>Number 27 was Alberto Del Rio. He went right after Ryback. Cesaro and Ambrose battled in the center as everyone else battled in the corners. Harper tossed Ambrose over but he slid under the ropes. Cesaro slammed Rollins.</p>
<p>Number 28 was Batista. He killed everyone with clotheslines. Lots of boos when the music stopped. He forced Rowan over the top.</p>
<p>Eric Rowan has been eliminated.</p>

<p>Number 30 was Rey Mysterio. The crowd booed the hell out this when the music stopped. Rey used a head scissors to take Rollins out but he held on. The crowd chanted for Daniel Bryan.</p>
<p>Rey and Punk battled and both went over the top. They were close to touching the floor. The crowd kept booing. Langston and Sheamus battled in the center. Langton was clotheslined over the top but held on. Sheamus clotheslined him off the apron.</p>
<p>Langston has been eliminated.</p>
<p>Mysterio nailed the 619 on Rollins. Rollins came back with a backdrop over the top to the apron, then dropkicked Rey to the floor. The crowd is still chanted for Daniel Bryan. The Shield battled with Harper but Reigns used the Superman punch to eliminate him.</p>
<p>Harper has been eliminated.</p>

<p>We are down to the final four - Punk, Reigns, Batista and Sheamus. They all nailed their big moves.</p>

<p>Punk has been eliminated.</p>
<p>The crowd is still chanting for Daniel Bryan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s down to Batista, Reigns and Sheamus and the crowd is booing them.</p>
<p>Sheamus clotheslined Reigns. Sheamus and Batista battled back and forth. Batista nailed a running clothesline in the corner. He then slammed Reigns. The crowd chanted, &ldquo;NO!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sheamus nailed the rolling Samoan Drop and pointed at the Wrestlemania sign. He called for the Brogue Kick Everytime he beat his chest the crowd yelled &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Batista ducked the kick. He went for a Batista Bomb but Sheamus escaped. Batista sent him over the top and Reigns drilled him off the apron.</p>
<p>Sheamus has been eliminated.</p>
<p>Batista dumped Reigns who pulled himself under the ropes. They faced off and the crowd booed them both. They faced off. Batista kicked him in the gut and sent him into the corner. Reigns came out with a big clothesline. He set up for the Superman Punch. The crowd, perhaps deciding on the lesser of two evils, chanted his name. He went for it but Batista nailed an awful looking spear. The place booed. Reigns came back with a good spear of his own.</p>
<p>He went to toss Batista but Batista caught him and tossed Reigns over instead.</p>
<p>Your winner, headlining Wrestlemania 30, Batista!</p>
<p>The crowd could be heard booing the win, even over Batista&rsquo;s music. There were also some &ldquo;No&rdquo; chants afterward.</p>
<p>They closed the show with Batista pointing at the Mania sign and lots of pyro going off.</p>

<p><strong>VINCE MCMAHON IS DEAF, THE FANS CALL FOR BRYAN AT NUMBER 19, THE RUMBLE GETS BIG SEXY, THE OTHER NUMBER ONE GUY IN THE RUMBLE AND THE FIRST ONE OUT, SINCE VINCE MCMAHON DOESN&rsquo;T SEEM TO HEAR THEM, THE WWE UNIVERSE MAKES THEIR FEELINGS KNOWN DURING THE WWE TITLE MATCH - FULL ROYAL RUMBLE BLOG</strong></p>
<p>By Dave Scherer on 2014-01-26 19:56:26</p>
<p>In the back Vickie was with some Rumble guys. No one was telling what they got. Kofi didn&rsquo;t like his. R Truth hated his, he must be two. Alberto liked his. Swagger liked Cesaro&rsquo;s better than his. Khali didn&rsquo;t like his. It must be bad because Sandow said maybe next year. Then Sandow drew and his was bad too.</p>
<p>RUMBLE TIME! Punk is out first. The guy who got the other number one is&hellip;..Representing The SHIELD, Seth Rollins!</p>
<p>Punk was going for GTS as time ran down but didn&rsquo;t get it. Damien Sandow is third. Now we know why Khali was laughing. They worked over Punk. Number four was Cody Rhodes, who came in and evened the odds by going right after Sandow. &hellip; And the first one eliminated, Sandow by Punk!</p>
<p>Number five was KANE, with dress pants and no mask. He went right after Punk. Do you get the theme here? You know who is working HHH at Mania right? Anyway, before the next guy came out, as Kane was going for a chokeslam Punk dumped him out. At number six, making his debut, Alexander Rusev. He is huge.</p>
<p>Rusev came in and made a big impression. He threw a few over the top but they didn&rsquo;t hit the floor. He did a fallaway slam on Punk. He went to toss Cody when Rollins jumped on his back. At number 7 is Jack Swagger. He ran to the ring. He faced off with Rusev and they threw big shots at each other. At number 8 came Kofi Kingston. He went after Punk right away. Ain&rsquo;t happening Kofi. Get ready for your not hitting the floor spot. Cody tried to eliminate Punk. Not happening either. &hellip; At number 9 is Jimmy Uso. And at 10 is Goldust. He came in a house afire until he ran into Rusev, who then got worked over by Punk and Cody.</p>
<p>The guys worked together and got rid of the big man, Rusev. Kofi got tossed over the top. Rusev put him on the barricade and worked him over but, his feet didn&rsquo;t hit the floor. This is this year&rsquo;s Kofi spot. He got up and walked on the barricade and jumped from it to the apron. He is back in. JBL made reference to a long jumper from the 60s. Ugh. &hellip; Number 11 is Dean Ambrose. &hellip; Number 12 was Hacksaw&rsquo;s pick, Dolph Ziggler. The crowd popped big doing a Let&rsquo;s Go Ziggler chant so of course he was immediately in peril of being tossed after a good initial run. Vince said SHUT THEM UP! &hellip; The crowd was great at doing countdowns. R-Truth is number 13. And just that quick, Dean Ambrose dumped him out. And then Ambrose eliminated Jimmy Uso. Kofi&rsquo;s did a second spot where he was pushed out but used his feet to hook the ropes and not hit the floor. Two Kofi spots. &hellip; Number 14 continued the oldies show as Kevin Nash came out. He immediately eliminated Jack Swagger. I guess they forget his last program in WWE. Hopefully Punk tosses him. He owes him. &hellip; At number 15 is Roman Reigns. All three Shield guys are now in the ring.</p>
<p>Reigns made a big entrance, cleaning house and eliminating Kofi, Ziggler and Nash. Goldust and Cody worked on Reigns but Rollins made the Shield. At number 16 is The Great Khali. Throw him out right away, please? Instead, they had all three Shield guys sell for him for a spot, then they dumped him. Cody eliminated his brother, and Reigns then eliminated Cody. We are down to The Shield and CM Punk when at number 17 Sheamus returns. Sheamus came in and went after the Shield when they went after him. Ambrose got to take the forearms to the chest spot. Rollins got the Irish Curse. Reigns got a Brogue Kick. Punk is still out of site for the most part. &hellip; At number 18 is The Miz. At 19, Fandango. He doesn&rsquo;t dance, he runs in and Miz goes right after him. The fans do the Fandago. And out of nowhere, a DANIEL BRYAN chant. And then at number 20 is Los Matador&hellip;&hellip;Torito. Yes, the bull is this year&rsquo;s Santino.</p>
<p>Fandango went after Torito and tried to doss him but instead Torito eliminated him. Then Roman tossed Torito. No harm no foul. &hellip; At 21, Antonio Cesaro. He did the Big Swing on Miz. Went to do it on Punk but the Shield broke it up. So he did the Bug Swings on them, a real long one on Seth Rollins. Stupid long. I lost count, like 40 revolutions. &hellip; At number 22, Luke Harper. He went right after Roman. At number 23, Jey Uso. At number 24 JBL. He got up from ringside and took off the headset and walked into the ring, wearing suit and tie. He took off his jacked and asked Cole to come get it, allowing Roman to dump him. He got a you still got it chant. At number 25 Erick Rowan. He dumped Miz. Ryback is number 26. At number 27 is Alberto. Big Dave is getting a good spot so he doesn&rsquo;t have to do much.</p>
<p>At number 28 we got Big Dave. As he ran to the ring his pecs bounced, like, well, they were the chest of a female. He got some boos. He eliminated Rowan and then faced off with Ryback, who threw Dave down. As Ryback ran into the corner, Dave backdropped him out. ADR went to work on Batista. But Dave tossed ADR. Then at 29 out came Big E Langston. Big E went to work on Sheamus. With one spot, the fans chanted YES! And at number 30, DANIEL BRYAN! No, I am just kidding. It was Rey Mysterio. The fans booed. Loudly. Way to go Vince. Then they chanted for Bryan. And WAY TO GO PITT FANS!</p>
<p>Sheamus dumped Big E. Someone dumped Rey, sorry Pizza came. Roman eliminated Harper. Rollins went to dump Roman. Cesaro went to dump Rollins and Ambrose when Roman dumped all three. Down to the final four, Punk, Reigns, Batista and Sheamus. Kane came from out of nowhere and pulled Punk out. Weak. Kane choekslammed him through the announce table. The fans chanted Daniel Bryan again. Reigns has tied Kane with 11 eliminations. It&rsquo;s a good night for him. They all went against each other. Batista caught Roman as he tried to do a spear, the fans chanted NO. They listen to the Mailbag. Sheamus called for the Brogue Kick as the fans chanted NO and booed. Batista got out of the way and went for the Bomb but Sheamus got out. He was on the apron and Reigns knocked him out, breaking the record. The crowd does not want Batista. Vince will not call an audible. The fans are booking Batista. If they put Reigns over, they can save it. They won&rsquo;t. &hellip; They face off and battle. Reigns hits the big clothesline and they popped. They chanted for Reigns. Vince doesn&rsquo;t have his hearing aids in. Batista hit a spear on Reigns and the crowd boos loud. Reigns hits the spear and the crowd goes nuts. Instead, Big Dave tossed him out. Some fans popped, more booed. They did all they could to drown the fans out. But they weren&rsquo;t happy. Vince you don&rsquo;t know what we want more than we do.</p>

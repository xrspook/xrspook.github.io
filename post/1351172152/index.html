<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-04-15 22:01:49</p>
<p>We begin tonight’s show with a look back at Edge’s victory over Alberto Del Rio at Wrestlemania. Then we move ahead to Edge’s comments from this Monday’s Raw when he announced his retirement. What will happen when Edge forfeits his title?</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Albany, New York and your announcers are Michael ‘I want to be like William Regal when I grow up’ Booker ‘I will buy the next bottle of shampoo’ T, and Josh ‘Babysitting Michael Cole since 2010’ Mathews.</p>
<p>Tony Chimmel introduces Ricardo Rodriguez so he can introduce Alberto Del Rio. Alberto drives into the arena in a new vehicle.</p>
<p>Alberto gets the mic and he reminds us who he is, but tonight is not about him. It is about somebody else. Last Monday on Raw, when Edge announced his retirement the entire locker room and the WWE Universe lost a hero. When he thinks about Edge, he thinks about respect. In his thirteen years in WWE, he held more titles than anyone else. Now he is giving up on everything in this incredible business. Alberto says that he cannot imagine how Edge feels right now.</p>
<p>This was his life. It was his passion. It was his love. Alberto says that even though it was his destiny to be the World Champion, he did not want it to happen this way. Since Alberto says that since Edge is here to surrender the World Title, and because he earned the number one contender spot, Edge should come out right now and present him with the World Title.</p>
<p>Alberto waits for Edge to come out to give him the title and the fans chant for Edge.</p>
<p>Instead of Edge, Smackdown General Manager Teddy Long makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Alberto and Teddy shake hands and Teddy tells Alberto that he is sorry to disappoint him because it is not going to go down the way that Alberto suggested. No one is presenting Alberto with anything.</p>
<p>Teddy agrees with Alberto that he is the number one contender. He says that Alberto has earned the right to wrestle for the title at Extreme Rules in a Ladder Match. That is what Alberto is going to do. We will find out who Alberto faces and it will be determined in a twenty man battle royal.</p>
<p>Alberto wants to know what Teddy is talking about. Alberto says that he should be the champion. Alberto says that this is a conspiracy. Alberto says that he never liked Teddy.</p>
<p>Teddy tells Alberto that is how they roll on Smackdown. Alberto tells Teddy that he is glad that he hurt Edge. Alberto says that he is glad that he is the man who forced Edge to retire. It was Edge’s destiny to end up like a crippled coward. Alberto says that it is also his destiny to be the World Champion.</p>
<p>Teddy cuts Alberto off and tells him it is his destiny to shut up.</p>
<p>We are back and Edge is in the back with Rosa Mendes and she is talking to him in Spanish. Edge says that he has no idea what she said but she had him at ‘quiero’. Rosa says that everyone is going to miss Edge for everything that he has done for the business. She cannot imagine not seeing him again.</p>
<p>Edge turns around and Alberto Del Rio is behind him. Alberto looks at Edge and he offers his hand. Edge thinks about it but he walks away.</p>
<p>We see the title belt at ringside and Alberto Del Rio is standing by it as he watches to see who will be his opponent at Extreme Rules.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Four: Number One Contender Battle Royal</strong></p>
<p>The participants in the battle royal are Big Show, Kane, Justin Gabriel, Heath Slater, Jack Swagger, Wade Barrett, Brodus Clay, Christian, Ezekiel Jackson, Cody Rhodes, Drew McIntyre, Yoshi Tatsu, Kofi Kingston, Rey Mysterio, Tyler Reks, Chris Masters, Chavo Guerrero, Curt Hawkins, Trent Barreta, and JTG</p>
<p>The bell rings and everyone goes after someone and we see a lot of punching and kicking, but JTG is eliminated first. Jackson goes afer Show. Barreta tries to eliminate Big Show but that is a mistake because Barreta is eliminated. Kofi fights off Drew McIntyre and Masters tries to eliminate McIntyre. Show with a head butt to Reks. Hawkins stays in the ring despite Swagger’s attempts to eliminate him. Slater is sent to the apron and Show knocks Slater off the apron while knocking him out with the punch.</p>
<p>Show charges at Ezekiel Jackson and the momentum of the clothesline sends both of them over the top rope to the floor and both men are eliminated. Del Rio applauds that Show is not going to win. Kane with an uppercut to Reks and Clay with a head butt to Chavo.</p>
<p>Masters holds Barrett but Barrett with punches. Cody tries to eliminate Yoshi but Kane grabs Cody and sends him into the turnbuckles. Kofi is holding on while Swagger and McIntyre try to eliminate him.</p>
<p>We go to commercial while Chavo goes to the apron.</p>
<p>We are back and Masters has Hawkins in the Master Lock but that doesn’t matter. Rhodes has Mysterio on the turnbuckles but Chavo makes the save for Rey. Christian tries to eliminate Clay. Rhodes tries to grind Rey’s groin while in the tree of woe, but Masters stops him but he only hits him with a forearm that allows Cody to get back into the ring.</p>
<p>Kofi punches Drew and Kane joins in the attempt to eliminate him. Barret punches Kane while Reks slams Gabriel and he drops a knee. Yoshi saves himself from being eliminated. Cody with a forearm to Rey. Chavo tries to eliminate Curt Hawkins but Hawkins holds on to the ropes. Rey sends Cody to the apron and Rey tries to send Cody into the turnbuckles but Cody blocks it. Rey with a springboard drop kick and Rhodes is eliminated. Hawkins gets Rey on his shoulders and Rey uses the ropes to propel Hawkins over the top rope to the floor while Rey stays alive in the match.</p>
<p>Kane with a clothesline in the corner to Reks. Masters puts McIntyre on the Master Lock on the apron but McIntyre escapes the hold. Clay eliminates McIntyre. Chavo climbs on Clay’s back and Brodus flips Chavo to the floor. Swagger with forearms to Kofi. Clay and Kane go face to face and it is time to see if the Sheeeee can withstand the power of the uppercut. The first shot is taken by Kane and he connects with an uppercut. Kane with more punches and then he gets Clay by the throat but Clay with elbows and a head butt to the chest. Clay gets Kane up for a power slam but Kane gets out of the hold. Clay is eliminated by Kane. Kane has a smile on his face while Del Rio is not a happy camper. We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and are down to ten men in the match. Kane, Jack Swagger, Christian, Yoshi Tatsu, Kofi Kingston, Wade Barrett, Rey Mysterio, Tyler Reks, Chris Masters, and Justin Gabriel.</p>
<p>Kofi is sent over the top rope but he skins the cat and he gets Barrett in a head scissors. Kofi tries to send Barrett over the top rope but Barrett gets free and he kicks Kofi and sends him to the floor to eliminate him. Rey waits on the apron while the numbers get lower. Masters and Reks battle in the ring and Masters with chops. Gabriel goes after Kane and Kane with an uppercut.</p>
<p>Yoshi kicks Barrett but Barrett sends Yoshi into the turnbuckles. Reks kicks Christian and Rey kicks him in the leg. Gabriel with a rake of the eyes to Kane. Christian sends Reks to the apron and Reks sends Christian into the turnbuckles but Christian drops Reks on the top rope and Reks is eliminate.</p>
<p>Barrett with a kick to Masters while Swagger works on Kane. Yoshi with kicks to Christian but he misses a round kick and Christian takes advantage and eliminates Yoshi. Kane makes the save for Rey when Swagger tries to eliminate him. Kane with a clothesline to Gabriel but Gabriel goes to the turnbuckles. He comes off the turnbuckles and he is caught by Kane. Kane sets for the choke slam and then he grabs Barrett by the throat with his other hand. Gabriel and Barrett stop Kane and then they clothesline Kane over the top rope to eliminate him.</p>
<p>Barrett with a running boot to Masters and then he punches him. Masters with chops to Barrett. Masters is sent to the apron and he tries for the Master Lock but Barrett gets out of the hold. Barrett kicks Masters off the apron to eliminate him. Gabriel comes up behind his fellow Corre member and he eliminates Barrett.</p>
<p>Barrett and Gabriel have some words as we are down to the final four. Christian, Jack Swagger, Justin Gabriel, and Rey Mysterio. They stand in their respective corners as the carnage at ringside is cleaned up. Swagger goes after Christian while Gabriel goes after Rey. Rey sends Gabriel into the turnbuckles while Christian gets Swagger on his shoulders. Gabriel with a spinning heel kick. Swagger with a knee to Christian. Rey sends Gabriel into the ropes and that means that it is 619 time but Gabriel ducks out of the way. Gabriel gets Rey up for a power bomb but in a battle royal, you never try to power bomb Rey because he finds a way to get to the ropes and he eliminates Gabriel with a head scissors while Rey returns to the ring.</p>
<p>Christian kicks Swagger while Del Rio surveys what is going on. Rey kicks Christian and then he hits a springboard cross body. Swagger throws Rey over the top rope but Rey holds on to the ropes. Rey with a shoulder from the apron and then Rey goes up top for a head scissors that sends Swagger into the ropes. Michael Cole leaves his bunker to be a humanoid shield for Jack Swagger on the eventual 619. Cole takes the brunt of the move to protect Swagger.</p>
<p>Swagger brings Rey back into the ring because Rey did not go over the top rope and then Rey tries to eliminate Swagger, but Jack holds on to the ropes and Rey is eliminated.</p>
<p>We are down to two and it is Jack Swagger and Christian. Swagger kicks Christian and then he tries for the double jump Swagger bomb, but Swagger gets caught on the ropes and Christian is also able to recover. Christian tries to send Swagger over the top rope to the floor but Swagger punches Christian and gets back into the ring. Swagger with a boot to the head.</p>
<p>Christian goes to the apron and he pulls Swagger to the apron. Christian with an elbow and then he tries for the pendulum kick but Swagger blocks it and he applies the ankle lock. They return to the ring with the ankle lock applied. Christian rolls through to escape the hold. Swagger gets Christian on his shoulders but Christian gets to his feet and he tries to eliminate Swagger, but he can’t get him over. Swagger with a kick and then he tries to throw Christian over the top rope to the floor but Christian holds on to the ropes. Del Rio goes to the ring and he grabs Christian by the ankle to allow Swagger the chance to eliminate Christian but Christian kicks Del Rio away and then he ducks down when Swagger charges at him and Swagger is eliminated.</p>
<p>Winner: Christian</p>
<p>After the match, Del Rio shows a lot of frustration over his opponent at Extreme Rules.</p>
<p>Edge comes to the ring and he hugs Christian as he helps Christian celebrate his victory. Del Rio stands on the announce table and Del Rio points to the title belt as he tells Christian that it is his destiny.</p>
<p>Edge raises Christian’s hand in victory.</p>

<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2010-10-22 21:59:22</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and your announcers are Matt ‘The Don Cherry of Wrestling Announcers’ Striker, Todd ‘The Ron McLean of Wrestling Announcers’ Grisham, and Michael ‘Schiavone’ Cole.</p>
<p>We begin with thirteen of the fourteen men (plus Alex ‘Seat Filler’ Riley) involved in the Bragging Rights Elimination Match in the ring with Teddy Long and the Bragging Rights Cup. This week there is a red and blue tablecloth on the official presenting table.</p>
<p>Teddy welcomes everyone to Smackdown. He reminds us that there will be an elimination match at Bragging Rights. Teddy announces that he won’t be making the matches tonight, for the first time. He is going to let the Superstars select the matches tonight. Teddy lets the Raw captain choose first, but Miz tells Teddy that he should be thanking him for allowing Team Raw to grace the B Show with their presence. He says that Teddy should be thanking him for the ratings boost that they are going to give this show because of the superstars on ‘this’ side of the ring, not ‘that’ side. Miz says that he has already proven his superiority over Smackdown’s captain so we are going to have a six man tag match. Miz says that he will be joined by Ezekiel Jackson and Sheamus.</p>
<p>Show says that he isn’t surprised that Miz is hiding behind two powerhouses when Miz was always hiding behind him when they were tag team partners. Show asks Miz if he still has the bedwetting problem. Show mentions Sheamus and Ezekiel Jackson as powerhouses so he needs some speed so he chooses Kofi Kingston. Show says that he is also going to choose the heart and soul of Smackdown and that when he is in trouble, he doesn’t call 911, he calls 619 so the third member of the team will be Rey Mysterio.</p>
<p>Edge tells Teddy that since they are making the matches, he wants to be in action tonight. Edge says that he wants a singles match against the most obnoxious, self righteous, condescending, sanctimonious superstar on either brand. Edge says that he wants CM Punk.</p>
<p>Punk is surprised that he is called obnoxious.</p>
<p>John Morrison says that he wants to challenge someone who thinks that he is better than everyone. Someone who thinks that he is too good to be here. Someone who thought that he could be a member of Menudo. Someone who has trouble speaking the English language. Morrison says that he isn’t talking about Jack Swagger. He wants to face Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>Swagger says that doesn’t leave a lot for him. He says that he will face the man whose finisher is worse than the Sharpshooter. He says that he isn’t talking about the Miz. He wants to face the superstar with a unibrow and then he will wipe it off his face. He wants to face Santino Marella.</p>
<p>Teddy says that we have our matches so it is time for the first match and it is the six man tag match.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Three: Alberto Del Rio versus John Morrison in a Bragging Rights Preview Match</strong></p>
<p>They lock up and Del Rio backs Morrison into the corner and he connects with a knee out of the break. Del Rio sends Morrison into the turnbuckles followed by a snap mare and kick to the back. Morrison with a double leg take down followed by punches and a Shining Wizard for a near fall. Del Rio sends Morrison into the turnbuckles followed by a back breaker for a near fall. Del Rio with a rear chin lock with his knee in Morrison’s back. Del Rio with a forearm to the back followed by an Irish whip and kick to the back by Del Rio. Del Rio with a belly-to-back suplex for a near fall. Del Rio works on the back and then he returns to the rear chin lock.</p>
<p>Morrison with punches to Del Rio followed by a rollup for a near fall. Del Rio goes for a splash in the corner but Del Rio lands awkwardly. Morrison with clotheslines followed by a leg lariat and Morrison gets a near fall. Morrison with a kick but Del Rio wit a German suplex and bridge for a near fall. Del Rio with shoulder in the corner but he misses the step up enzuigiri. Morrison tries for the corkscrew split legged moonsault but Del Rio gets his knees up and Morrison gets to his feet holding his left arm. Del Rio floats over and puts Morrison in the cross arm breaker and Morrison taps.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>After the match, Miz and Riley send Edge into the ringside barrier. They check on Punk in the ring and Kofi Kingston comes out and he gives Riley Trouble in Paradise. Miz gives Kofi the Skull Crushing Finale. Tyler Reks gives Miz a Burning Hammer. Morrison with a tornado DDT to Reks. Del Rio sends Morrison into the turnbuckles and hits the step up enzuigiri. Ezekiel Jackson with a spine buster but Swagger puts Jackson in an ankle lock. Santino comes out and Swagger blocks the cobra and Swagger with a Doctor Bomb to Santino. Sheamus with a pump kick. Show makes his way to the ring and he gives Jackson a choke slam. Sheamus with a pump kick that sends Show to the floor. Rey with a drop kick to the knees and Rey hits the 619 on Sheamus. Punk gives Rey Go To Sleep but Edge finishes the succession of finishers with a spear on CM Punk.</p>
<p>Team Smackdown stands together in the ring as Team Raw goes go the back.</p>

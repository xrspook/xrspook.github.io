<p><strong>RAW SUPER SHOW REPORT: THE HALL OF PAIN HAS A PREVIEW OPENING; TRIPLE H AND CM PUNK HAVE A DISCUSSION IN THE RING; AND OTHER STUFF AS WE MOVE TO NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-09-12 23:05:25</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Kanata, Ontario, Canada and your announcers are Michael ‘Are you sure we aren’t in Ottawa’ Cole, Jim ‘Even with three downs, it is still football’ Ross, and Jerry ‘Tim Horton’s or bust’ Lawler.</p>
<p>We start off tonight’s super show with a super champion in the super ring with his super ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez. He asks if it is going to be like this where the people are going to boo him. He says that it is okay because he can take that. He cannot take being disrespect. Ricardo starts to yell at the crowd but Del Rio takes the mic away. He says that last week John Cena hit him with an AA and the WWE Universe made fun of him. Alberto reminds us that he is the Undisputed WWE Champion and no one makes fun of him.</p>
<p>Alberto reminds us that he took care of Rey Mysterio and he retired somebody and he reminds us that it was Edge. Alberto says that he forced Edge to retire. He beat CM Punk at SummerSlam and he is going to teach John Cena a lesson at Night of Champions. Alberto tells everyone to stop making fun of us. He reminds us who he is and that he is the Undisputed WWE Champion. He says that he is the greatest of the great.</p>
<p>Since we are North of the Border, if someone is called great, that means that Bret Hart has to come out to the ring.</p>
<p>Bret talks to his amigo in the ring and he says that he didn’t come out here to disrespect him. He wanted to give Alberto some advice and an education. When he looks at Alberto, he sees him wearing the WWE Championship belt, but he sees a man who does not know what it means to be the World Champion.</p>
<p>Alberto reminds Bret that he destroyed Rey Mysterio and Edge.</p>
<p>Bret says that you don’t call yourself a champion when you beat up a crippled wrestler. He says that Alberto is all style and no substance. He tells Alberto to be a champion and a man with pride. A man who fights all challengers day in and day out. That is how you become the World Champion and the best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be.</p>
<p>Alberto asks Bret if he wants to make fun of him. Why not have a former champion who looks like a bum with the 1994 jacket and greasy hair. He says that Bret looks like one of those illegal Canadians he hires to clean his house. Alberto says that he is the best there is. He is the WWE Champion. Tonight, he will make an example of Bret.</p>
<p>Alberto better make that example quick because John Cena’s music plays and he makes his way to the ring, but he takes his time coming to the ring to help Bret.</p>
<p>Cena welcomes everyone for the welcome and he says that he disagrees with Alberto. He says that he doesn’t see what Alberto described about Bret. He sees a WWE Hall of Famer. Cena says that he has no visible proof but it appears that Alberto has grown a set of jalapenos. He says that after a month of running away like a coward he stays in the ring. Cena tells Alberto to leave in his car and go back to Mexico and party like there’s no tomorrow. Cena says that Alberto is the WWE Champion for six more days.</p>
<p>Cena says that he has told everyone but he will tell Alberto to his face that he will beat him at Night of Champions.</p>
<p>Alberto says that they should give the fans what they want. Cena says that if he wants to fight, let’s do it now. Alberto asks Cena if he has the cajones to see John Cena face Ricardo Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Rodriguez drops Alberto’s scarf to surrender. Alberto says that Ricardo wants to make Cena pay for what he did a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Cena says that he did not expect to see Alberto throw Ricardo in his way. If Alberto wants to make a special match for tonight, Cena suggests that we have a match with Alberto Del Rio defending the title against Bret Hart tonight.</p>
<p>John Laurinaitis interrupts and he reminds us who he is even though John Cena said it a few seconds earlier. John says that we give everyone the match that they want to see. Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez versus John Cena and Bret Hart.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Four: John Cena and Bret Hart versus Ricardo Rodriguez and Alberto Del Rio</strong></p>
<p>Ricardo and Cena start things off and Cena plays a little ole with Ricardo using his orange shirt. Ricardo begs for Alberto to tag in but Cena throws the shirt into the crowd. Del Rio goes to the floor and Ricardo hits Cena from behind and Ricardo apologizes immediately. Cena with a back body drop and Ricardo makes the hug tag for Alberto.</p>
<p>Cena chases Del Rio and Ricardo around the ring and Del Rio kicks Cena when he gets back into the ring. Del Rio punches Cena. Del Rio with a kick and an Irish whip but Cena with a clothesline out of the corner followed by another clothesline. Cena with a splash into the corner and a drop kick. Cena tries for the Attitude Adjustment and Ricardo grabs Del Rio to pull him away and Ricardo makes the tag.</p>
<p>Cena with the two shoulder tackles followed by the Blue Thunder Bomb and then Cena with the Five Knuckle Shuffle and the Attitude Adjustment. Cena tags in Hart to put Ricardo into the Sharpshooter while Del Rio goes up the ramp to the back. Ricardo taps out very quickly.</p>
<p>Winners: Bret Hart and John Cena</p>
<p>After the match, Cena tells Alberto to run all the way to Night of Champions. At the end of Night of Champions, the Champ is HERE!!</p>

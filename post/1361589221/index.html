<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: CHAMPION VERSUS CHAMPION; ORTON VERSUS SWAGGER; CODY FIGHTS A ONE ARMED MAN; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-02-22 21:59:34</p>
<p>The Road to Wrestlemania is a few days closer to its destination. Jack Swagger will be facing Alberto Del Rio for the World Title and he will be doing it for Americans. The Rock has a new title belt while we do not know who will have the chance to change the plates on the side of the belt.</p>
<p>This week, we are in Biloxi, Mississippi and your announcers are Josh’ They have casinos here too’ Mathews and John ‘Get your Bingo cards and drinking game rules ready’ Layfield.</p>
<p>Lillian Garcia introduces Ricardo Rodriguez and he introduces the man who has the longest current reigning major championship belt in WWE history, Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, we have photos of Big Show tapping out to Alberto at the Elimination Chamber.</p>
<p>Del Rio says that at the Elimination Chamber, he retained his World Title. That means that they are going to Wrestlemania and they prove it by pointing to the sign. Alberto says that he found out who his opponent would be and that man is Jack Swagger. Alberto says that Jack has a new mission, a new friend, and a new attitude. Jack believes that he is everything that is right with America while Alberto is everything that is wrong with America.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he has heard Jack and saw what he had to say. Jack says that the problem in this country is with the immigrants who are taking jobs from people like Jack. This country was built by immigrants who were chasing the American dream. It was built by families looking for a better life. That is why America is so great.</p>
<p>The title is the result of his hard work and the American dream. Jack claims to be the ‘Real American’, Alberto thinks that he is the ‘Real Jackass’. Alberto tells Jack to come out so he can lay his hand out across Jack’s face.</p>
<p>Jack Swagger does not come out, but Randy Orton does make his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Randy has something to say and he tells Alberto that he is going to do his absolute best to stay calm, cool, and collected. Something was taken from him this past Sunday. He was this close to having the opportunity to regain the World Title against Alberto in the main event of Wrestlemania. It was taken by Jack Swagger.</p>
<p>Randy says that he respects Swagger because he would have done the same thing. Part of him wants to take out his rage on Jack Swagger tonight. Randy says that Alberto is wrestling Swagger at Wrestlemania. He wants Alberto to step aside tonight so he can take care of Swagger tonight.</p>
<p>Even though nobody has moved towards taking an offensive action in the ring, Booker T comes out and he says that this is not how he sees Smackdown going down. Booker has a few ideas. There will be a champion versus champion match. Alberto Del Rio will face Wade Barrett. Jack Swagger will be facing Randy Orton tonight.</p>
<p>Randy has his wish and Booker wants to know if someone wants to dig.</p>
<p>Jack Swagger is walking in the back and Zeb gives Jack a pep talk.</p>
<p>Wade Barrett says that he is not one to give out compliments, but he wants to say that it is about time that someone spoke the truth about what is going on in this country. He is looking forward to doling out some punishment on one of the main perpetrators.</p>
<p>Zeb tells Wade that there is an understanding. Wade doesn’t sound like him and he doesn’t sound like someone from around here. He asks Wade where he is from. Wade says that he is from England. Zeb tells Wade that he is part of the problem because he is stealing a job from an American. He suggests that Wade and Del Rio go out there and beat each other up so they can be sent back to where they come from in a two-for-one deal.</p>
<p>Jack tells Wade ‘We The People’ and Zeb tells Jack it is time to go.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Five: Wade Barrett versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez)</strong></p>
<p>Barrett works on the wrist but Del Rio rolls through and he kicks Barrett and sends him to the mat. Barrett wants to know what Ricardo is laughing at. Barrett with an elbow and punches to Del Rio’s midsection. Del Rio with kicks to the chest. Del Rio with a snap mare and a kick to the back.</p>
<p>Ricardo mocks Barrett holding his back and Barrett chases after Ricardo and Del Rio with a drop kick and we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Barrett with elbows and kicks but Del Rio with punches. Barrett with an Irish whip but he runs into an elbow. Barrett pushes Del Rio off the turnbuckles and to the floor while we watch Swagger and Colter watch.</p>
<p>Barrett sends Del Rio’s head into the ring steps. Barrett Irish whips Del Rio into the ring steps and Del Rio holds his arm. Barrett gets a near fall. Barrett with a reverse chin lock on Del Rio. Del Rio with a punch and head butt but he misses a clothesline. Barrett with a back heel kick and then he hits a pump handle slam and gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Barrett puts Del Rio in the ropes and chokes him. Del Rio is put in the ropes and Barrett with knees and then he hits a running boot to the head and Del Rio falls to the floor. Barrett goes to the floor and sends Del Rio back into the ring and he gets a near fall. Barrett with a series of elbow drops and he gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Barrett with a reverse chin lock on Del Rio. Barrett with a knee and Irish whip but he runs into an elbow. Del Rio with a missile drop kick and both men are down. Barrett with a kick to the midsection but he misses a clothesline. Del Rio with two clotheslines. Barrett misses a clothesline and Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker. Del Rio with a super kick and Del Rio gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio charges at Barrett but Barrett with the Blackpool Slam and he gets a near fall. Barrett tries for Wasteland but Del Rio escapes. Barrett is put in the ropes and Del Rio with forearms to the back and then he hits a lungblower to get a near fall. Del Rio signals that it is time for the cross arm breaker but Swagger makes his way to the ring and Del Rio focuses on Swagger.</p>
<p>Barrett with a rollup and handful of tights for a near fall. Barrett with a boot to the head and then Barrett gets ready for the Bull Hammer but Del Rio avoids it and Del Rio floats over into the cross arm breaker and Barrett taps out.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>After the match, Del Rio and Swagger stare each other down and we go to credits.</p>

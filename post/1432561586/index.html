<p>LUCHA LIBRE WORLD CUP, Mexico City, Mexico</p>
<p>May 24, 2015</p>
<p>Report by Mike Killam for Wrestlezone.com</p>
<p>Discuss tonight’s epic collision between the biggest stars of TNA, Ring of Honor, Lucha Underground, Mexico, Japan and more in the comments section below. Use #Wrestlezone on social media to join in the discussion, and share this coverage page on Twitter using the following button!</p>
<p>-The show starts with both English and Spanish commentary over each other. Matt Striker later informs us (6:15) that they are working on fixing the problem.</p>
<p>-All the teams are being introduced. Team USA gets some great heat, as Jeff and Karen Jarrett accompany both groups down to the ring. Team Mexico blows the roof off the place, followed by the “Dream Team” of Rey Mysterio, Alberto El Patron and Myzteziz. A drumline comes out with the Mexican Army to present their colors and sing the national anthem.</p>
<p>-Dos Cara, El Fantasma, Canek (huge pop), Villano IV and V, Cien Caras, Universo 2000, Mascara Ano 2000, and broadcast legend Arturo Rivera are tonight’s all-star panel. They will vote on best match, performance, etc. tonight.</p>
<p>-The rules are simple. This will be a single elimination tournament with each match having a 15-minute time limit. If any match goes to a draw, one member of each team will be chosen to compete in a 5-minute singles contest to determine who advances. QUARTER-FINAL MATCHES</p>
<p>THE DREAM TEAM vs. TEAM NOAH Rey Mysterio, Alberto El Patron &amp; Myzteziz vs. Taiji Ishimori, Yoshihiro Takayama &amp; Atsushi Kotoge</p>
<p>They give the majority of the first half to letting the crowd soak in the return of these three major stars. Mysterio kicks off the match briefly, returns later to sell for big man Takayama, and it’s Myzteziz who handles most of the actual in-ring action. Ishimori looks like he had it with a big 450 splash. The finish comes with Mysterio flying off the apron to take out Kotoge, Patron knocking out Takayama with a superkick, and Myzteziz tapping out Ishimori with a tilt-a-whirl armbar submission.</p>
<p>Advancing: The Dream Team</p>
<p>SEMI-FINAL MATCHES</p>
<p>THE DREAM TEAM vs. TEAM USA #1</p>
<p>Double J puts over the young American team, saying Brian Cage is wearing Norman Smiley’s boots tonight. Vampiro never missing an opportunity, “I’ve known Norman for 30 years and he’s only bought two pairs of shoes in all that time.”</p>
<p>This one was all action from beginning to end, getting more and more crazy as the match goes on. Story of the match was pride and ego, as the Dream Team spent way too much time showboating for the fans – Vamp called them out on it dozens of times – and the rookies taking advantage of it. Lots of high-flying stuff, but also some ground game with Patron and Moose. They all ended up on the elevated ramp at one point, throwing suplexes. The tables turned in the end, when Moose gets cocky and starts toying with Patron, who rolls him into the cross armbreaker for the submission.</p>
<p>During the match, Patron threw the Mexican flag at Jeff Jarrett and the two teased going at it. Striker calmed him down, but they are definitely teasing something between them.</p>
<p>Advancing: The Dream Team</p>
<p>TOURNAMENT FINALS</p>
<p>THE DREAM TEAM vs. TEAM USA #2 Rey Mysterio, Alberto El Patron &amp; Myzteziz vs. Matt Hardy, Ken Anderson &amp; Johnny Mundo</p>
<p>Hardy and Mysterio locking up to start the match – lots of old memories being brought back. The heels tag in and out, playing mind games with Rey as they refuse to lock up with him. Patron has enough and tags in, making them get physical quickly. He goes to work on Mundo and tags in Myzteziz, who does some high-flying stuff but ends up selling for the heels for several minutes. At the halfway point, Patron gets back into it and hits Anderson with the step-up enzuigiri, but Hardy attacked from behind to keep the advantage in the heel corner. Eventually he hits a DDT out of the corner to mount a comeback, making the hot tag to Rey Mysterio for the big pop. Hardy and Mundo both take the 619 but Anderson saves the match. They set up a ridiculous Tower of Doom spot where all six guys basically crash and burn. Mysterio with a victory roll but the ref was checking on Patron, and Hardy breaks it up and hits the Side Effect. Alberto puts the armbar on Hardy, Anderson breaks it up and the heels now triple team the Heavyweight Champion with one minute left on the clock. They work over Patron and Hardy hits the Twist of Fate, but the clock runs off.</p>
<p>MYZTEZIZ vs. KEN ANDERSON</p>
<p>Both guys are exhausted. The match creeps along at a slow pace, moving from one big move to the next, with lots of last-minute kick-outs. They get down to one minute and Myzteziz hits the Swanton Bomb for a nearfall. Anderson hits the Mic Check for a nearfall, and the clock expires.</p>
<p>MATT HARDY vs. ALBERTO EL PATRON</p>
<p>Hardy attacks from behind as they’re figuring out who is going to get into the match. Matt puts on a sleeper hold as they’re both tired. Patron builds back and breaks the hold, throwing kicks in the corner and firing away with elbow shots. Hardy hits the Side Effect…two-count. Patron hits the Back Cracker…two-count. Hardy with the Twist of Fate…TWO-COUNT. Both guys are slow getting up as we hit one minute, but Patron fires off with a superkick. With 15 seconds left he locks in the armbar! 10..9…Hardy hangs on…5…4…3…and the clock expires.</p>
<p>JOHNNY MUNDO vs. REY MYSTERIO</p>
<p>They lock-up and break off, and there’s a ton of feeling out for the first two minutes. Mysterio out of nowhere hits a big DDT and hits the 619, then mounts the turnbuckle and hits a top rope splash! 1…2…KICKOUT! He goes for the 619 again, but Mundo catches his leg and hits the Moonlight Drive for a nearfall. Big knee shot to the face. Mysterio comes back with a superkick and connects with a springboard crossbody, but Mundo rolls through and hits him with Starship Pain! 1…2…Mysterio grabs the bottom rope. They fight to the top rope and Mysterio perches on his shoulders, hitting the victory roll from the top! 1…2…3! WINNERS: THE DREAM TEAM</p>
<p>Matt Striker and Vampiro say goodnight. They keep the feed going. Mysterio cuts a promo for the fans in Spanish – I can’t really tell what he’s saying, but I got the gist that he dedicated the win to Perry Aguayo. All the teams come down and get a good reaction from the fans. They start handing out awards from the judges. That’ll end our coverage for the night.</p>

<p><strong>AAA Lucha Libre World Cup Results - 5/24/15 (Live results)</strong></p>

<p>AAA Lucha Libre World Cup iPPV Results 5/24/15</p>
<p>AAA &ldquo;Lucha Libre World Cup&rdquo; iPPV Results May 24, 2015 Report by: Josh Boutwell of Wrestleview.com</p>
<p>Tonight stars from literally all over the world converge on Mexico City representing some of the biggest wrestling companies in the world (including AAA, TNA, ROH, Lucha Underground, All Japan Pro Wrestling, and Pro Wrestling NOAH) with young stars, veterans, legends, and future legends competing for the first ever “Lucha Libre World Cup” presented by AAA and Victoria Cerveza.</p>
<p>Tonight’s ring announcer comes down and introduces AAA owner Maricela Pena and botht he English and Spanish announcers are shown. The audio is not very good, I was streaming the show through my laptop onto my TV and I have a big surround sound setup and still ended up hooking up my headphones to the laptop to hear it. At the beginning they played both the Spanish and English commentaries at the same time so it was very annoying but was fixed eventually.</p>
<p>All of the teams were introduced to the crowd, the Dream Team got the huge ovation you would expect. Both Japan teams and both USA teams were introduced together, and all of the Mexican representatives were introduced together. Rey Misterio Jr. is wearing his throwback gear from his old days. His team are also wearing matching Mexican Flag styled gear to add a nice touch.</p>
<p>The Lucha Commission president, El Fantasma, is introduced and he welcomes everyone to the first ever Lucha World Cup. Matt Striker actually addressed the feed issues thus far with sound and other issues and said that it is being worked on. A video package is introduced to hype up the history of Lucha Libre and this tournament. My stream cut out me and when it returned I see the Villano brothers in the ring with Dos Caras and a man in a military outfit doing the Mexican national anthem.</p>
<p>They are using the four sided ring for this event. The judges for tonight: Dos Caras, El Fantasma, El Canek, Arturo Rivera, Villano IV, Villano V, Cien Caras, Mascara Ano 2000, &amp; Universo 2000 are introduced to the crowd. They are really making this feel like a special event, even if they are having the technical difficulties.</p>
<p>As the first match is being introduced my audio went out completely, but returned just as the Dream Team was coming out.</p>
<p>Lucha World Cup Quarterfinals The Dream TeAAAm (Rey Misterio Jr., Alberto el Patron, &amp; Myzteziz) vs. Team NOAH (Taiji Ishimori, Atsushi Kotoge, &amp; Yoshihiro Takayama)</p>
<p>Taiji Ishimori has worked for AAA many times in the past so this isn’t something new for him. I don’t know of Kotoge or Takayama working in Mexico much but I’m pretty sure Takayama has in the past. The ovation The Dream Team received was pretty special and about what you would expect. To be there live that must have been something special for those fans. Rey Misterio Jr. and Alberto are on a different level than anyone else in Mexico at this point, it’s pretty crazy. It is cool to see Rey wearing his old style of gear if nothing more than just nostalgia reasons. Remember, 15 minute time limit for these matches but there will be an overtime if it goes to a draw. Rey will start things off with Ishimori, this should be fun! They lockup and Ishimori forces Rey into the corner but they break clean until Ishimori shoves Rey. They lockup again and this time Ishimori gets Rey in a waistlock but Rey counters into an arm wringer and then sweeps the legs of Ishimori. They exchange sweeps and nearfalls and Ishimori immediately tags in Kotoge so Rey tags in Myzteziz. They lockup and exchange takedowns and armlocks. Myzteziz sweeps the legs of Kotoge and puts him in a Legbar. Kotoge reaches the ropes and then Myzteziz takes him down again and puts him in a Mexican Death Lock. Kotoge counters into a rollup for a nearfall but Myzteziz counters into a Mexican Surfboard! Myzteziz transitions into a pin for another nearfall. Myzteziz showing off his mat skills early on. Alberto tags in now as does Takayama, both of these men have a lot of MMA experience. They lockup and Alberto gets a side headlock on but Takayama shrugs him off and they run into each other with shoulder blocks. They exchange more shoulder blocks but neither man goes down and then begin slapping the piss out of each other! Takayama catches Alberto with a Belly-to-Belly Suplex for a quick nearfall but Alberto answers with a Step-Up Enziguri for a nearfall of his own. Alberto tosses Ishimori to the floor as he tries to interfere and then catches Kotoge with a Tilt-A-Whirl Backbreaker. Alberot whips him into the ropes and hits another Tilt-A-Whirl Backbreaker followed up by an Enziguri. Rey tags in and hits Ishimori with a Sliding Dropkick to the balls! Rey catches Ishimori with a Spinning Headscissors and then goes for the 619 but Takayama catches Rey in mid-move on the floor and tosses him into the ring post! Takayama tosses Rey into the ring post again and then rolls him back in the ring. Takayama tags in and stands on Rey for a nonchalant nearfall. Takayama hits a Yakuza Kick to Rey in the corner and tags Ishimori back into the match. Ishimori hits a crazy Facebuster and then Kotoge comes in and hits a Shining Wizard on Rey. Ishimori gets a nearfall and tags Kotoge into the match. Kotoge charges at Rey but Rey dropkicks him in the knees and reaches for the tag only for Ishimori to run in and cut him off. Kotoge whips Rey into the corner and then hits a Running Lariat to the back of Rey. Ishimori gets another nearfall and then tosses Rey into Takayama’s boot before tagging Ishimori back into the match. Ishimori goes for a Running Powerslam but Rey counters into a Spinning Tornado DDT! Rey tags Myzteziz into the match and he hits a series of kicks on Ishimori and then a Back Handspring Elbow! Myzteziz hits a Leaping Enziguri from the apron on Ishimori and then dives off the top with a Flying Cross Body! Myzteziz then hits a Press Slam Gutbuster for a nearfall before Takayma breaks it up! Alberot hits the Lung Blower on Takayama but Kotoge hits a Reverse DDT on Alberto! Rey hits a Flying Senton on Kotoge and Ishimori hits a Missile Dropkick on Rey! Myzteziz and Ishimori exchange chops and slaps. Myzteziz catches Ishimori with a hurricanrana and then a sliding dropkick to the knee! Myzteziz catches Ishimori with a La Magistral Cradle but Kotoge breaks it up. Takayama tosses Myzteziz across the ring and then Kotoge/Ishimori hit an Un-Prettier/450 Splash combo! 1…2…NO Alberto breaks it up! Rey and Alberto clothesline Takayama and Kotoge to the floor. Rey dives off the apron onto Kotoge and then Alberto Superkicks the hell out of Takayama! Back in the ring Myzteziz catches Ishimori in the La Mistica for the win!</p>
<p>Winners: The Dream Team via submission (La Mistica)</p>
<p>Lucha World Cup Semifinals The Dream TeAAAm vs. Team ROH/Underground</p>
<p>Rey has changed his gear up, wearing the more baggy tights type of gear he has wore the past decade or so. ACH has talked about how it was always his dream to face Rey Misterio Jr. so this is probably very cool for him. Team ROH/Underground attacks the Dream Team and they begin brawling all around. ACH dives off the apron onto Myzteziz while Moose places Rey on the top rope and then dropkicks him off the top to the floor! Alberto hits Moose from behind but Moose tosses him hard into the guardrail. Cage tosses Alberto into the ring and then hits a Delayed Vertical Suplex for a nearfall. Cage chokes Patron with the ropes and then tags Moose into the match. Alberto ducks a right hand and hits a Lung Blower on the big man! Rey tags into the match but the rudos beat him down in their corner. Cage tags into the match and then he hangs him up in the ropes from the apron and drags him over the top with a Superplex from the apron into the ring! ACH tags into the match and covers Rey for a nearfall. ACH tosses Rey under the ropes stomach first slamming him onto the concrete! Myzteziz comes in but ACH tosses him right back out and then ACH knocks Alberto off the apron. Cage drags Alberto up onto the stage and suplexes him on it! ACH hits a Sliding Dropkick under the ropes to Rey on the floor knocking him into the announce table. ACH drags Rey back in the ring and tosses him back into the rudo corner.

Moose counters it into a Sides Slam attempt but Rey counters into a Tornado DDT! Rey tags in Myzteziz who hits a Springboard Hurricanrana on ACH followed by a Superkick! Cage comes in and clotheslines Myzteziz and then he lifts Rey up in the air but Rey blocks it and shoves Cage to the floor! Patron runs back in and hits a Tope Suicida through the ropes onto Cage on the floor! Patron tosses Cage into the ring post and Rey holds ACH as Myzteziz Superkicks him! Patron drags Cage up on the ramp and gives him a receipt by Suplexing him on the stage! Rey and Myzteziz drag ACH up onto the stage as Patron Suplexes Cage again! Patron grabs ACH and Suplexes him on the stage as well! Rey and Myzteziz grab Moose and Double Suplex him on the stage now! Patron grabs a Mexican flag from a fan and waves it in Jarrett’s face which pisses him off. In the ring Myzteziz lifts ACH up in a Wheelbarrow and drops him down into a Facebuster from Rey! Rey gets a nearfall and then Cage comes in and Rey lifts Myztteziz up into the air into a dropkick on Cage! Cage rolls to the floor and Rey hits a Plancha off the apron onto Myzteziz as Cage pulled him into it! Cage then Powerbombs Rey onto the ring post and then ACH uses the ring post to fly around into a Headscissors onto Myzteziz! In the ring Moose and Patron square off and Alberto hits a DDT! Cage and ACH try to interfere but Alberto nocks him to the floor and then Alberto turns around into a Pop-Up Clothesline! Moose lifts Alberto to the top rope and then climbs up with him and attempts a Superplex, but Alberot hangs him up in the turnbuckles and hits a Diving Double Foot Stomp! Alberto then goes for the Destiny Armbar but Moose blocks it allowing Cage and ACH to hit him from behind. The ROH/Underground trio hit a Triple Powerbomb on Alberto but still only gets a nearfall! Cage and ACH whip Alberto into a Spear from Moose! 1…2…NO Rey breaks it up! Cage lifts Rey up but Rey bodyscissors Cage over the top to the floor! Rey then uses his legs to hold open the ropes as Myzteziz hits a Tope Suicida onto ACH &amp; Cage! Rey then hits an Asai Moonsault onto ACH &amp; Cage! Moose slaps Alberto repeatedly in the ring but the taunting hurts him as Alberto hits a Flying Armbar followed by a Superkick and then he locks in the Destiny Armbar! Moose taps!</p>
<p>Winners: The Dream Team via submission (Destiny Armbar)</p>
<p>Lucha Libre World Cup Finals The Dream TeAAAm vs. Team TNA/Underground</p>
<p>Rey is wearing a traditional Aztec headdress to the ring. Rey and Matt will start the match, it has been quite awhile since we have seen them in the ring together. They shake hands and then go to lockup but Matt tags Anderson instead which frustrates Rey. Rey and Anderson go to lockup but Anderson tags in Matt right back. It looks like the TNA tandem is messing with Rey&rsquo;s head. They finally lockup and Matt forces Rey into the corner and shoves him but Rey answers back with a shove of his own knocking Hardy on his ass! They lockup again and Matt gets Rey in a wristlock. Mundo tags into the match and puts Rey in a wristlock as of his own. Mundo whips Rey into the ropes but Rey catches him in a Wheelbarrow Armdrag!

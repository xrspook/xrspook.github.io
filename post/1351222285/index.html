<p><strong>WWE RAW REPORT: SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENS TO THE TAG DIVISION; WE HAVE AN OLD NEW NUMBER ONE CONTENDER THANKS TO A NEW OLD SUPERSTAR; THE TRUTH CAN BE PRETTY AWESOME</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-08-22 23:02:43</p>
<p>We are live from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and your announcers are Jim ‘Gretzky’ Ross, Jerry ‘Messier’ Lawler, and Michael ‘Pockington’ Cole.</p>
<p>icardo Rodriguez is in the ring and he introduces Alberto Del Rio as he makes his way to the ring over Michael Cole’s gushing.</p>
<p>We see footage from last week’s Raw when Alberto Del Rio was able to defeat Rey Mysterio in Rey’s home town of San Diego. We see footage of what happened after the match last week. Michael Cole tells us that due to the cross arm breaker Rey will be out of action.</p>
<p>Alberto tells us who he is . . . but we don’t even get that far because he is interrupted by John Cena who makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Cena and Del Rio get face to face and Cena tells Alberto that everyone knows who Del Rio is and that he is the man who thought the title was his destiny. John says that he wants to introduce himself to Alberto and he offers his hand to Del Rio. Cena says that he is the man who is going to take the WWE Championship off Alberto’s waist and he is going to hurt Del Rio. He will hurt him so bad that he will have to go home to his parents. Cena doubts that Alberto owns all of these cars. Cena says that he is a nice guy but Alberto is a target. Cena tells Del Rio that he is tired of making average seem awesome. There is only one person who can go toe to toe with him. . .</p>
<p>Cena says that Alberto is not CM Punk so when they meet for the WWE Championship, he is going to whip Del Rio’s ass.</p>
<p>Speaking of personality, CM Punk makes his way to the stage as his music plays. Punk makes his way to the ring. Punk says that he is feeling some déjà vu. Punk says that Cena wants another title match and he sarcastically says that it is awesome. Punk reminds Cena that he beat him twice in high pressure situations and then Alberto moseys on down and cashes in the Money in the Bank briefcase. If anyone is going to get a title match, it is him.</p>
<p>Punk says that it is ballsy for Cena to come out and make fun of Del Rio and his cars.</p>
<p>Del Rio reminds Cena and Punk that he is still here. He says that it is his time and he is the WWE Champion and he has the belt to prove it.</p>
<p>Punk wants to know if Del Rio is done and then he tells Del Rio never to interrupt him. He says that he doesn’t care that Del Rio cashed in the briefcase because he did it twice. Punk says that Del Rio reaped the rewards of the Money in the Bank Match. Punk says that this is part of a concerted effort by Del Rio, Triple H, Kevin Nash, and maybe even Jack Tunney trying to screw him over.</p>
<p>Punk says that since he has a problem, he tells John to pay attention to the past. John has had problems with Triple H in the past. Punk says that he insulted Hunter’s wife straight to her face at SummerSlam. Then magically Kevin Nash gets a text to take him out. Punk says that if Cena had won, it would have been to take out Cena. Someone wants Alberto to be champion really bad.</p>
<p>Del Rio says that it is destiny.</p>
<p>Punk says that Del Rio means ‘CM Punk officially cashing in his opportunity at the WWE Title’.</p>
<p>Cena says that Del Rio meant ‘John Cena cashing in his rematch tonight’</p>
<p>Punk says that Cena’s rematch clause is as real as Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Punk and Cena argue over who gets to face Alberto Del Rio for the title. Del Rio says that he is ignoring both of them. Del Rio says that it is his time and he defended his title last week so it is time for him to celebrate. Del Rio says that it won’t happen in Canada in front of this crowd. He tells Punk to stop crying like a little girl.</p>
<p>Before Del Rio can continue, the C-O-O s-t-o-p-s Del Rio and he makes his way to the ring. Hunter tells Del Rio to take the smug look off his face because he is not out here to protect him. Hunter says that Del Rio has a match and it is next. Hunter tells Cena and Punk that rematch clauses are not like Money in the Bank because you don’t get to cash them in when you like. Hunter says that is his job. Hunter says that whether you think he screwed your or sent a text at SummerSlam, the person who gets the rematch first will be decided by them. Alberto will defend the WWE Championship at Night of Champion against the person who wins tonight’s main event. It will be CM Punk versus John Cena.</p>

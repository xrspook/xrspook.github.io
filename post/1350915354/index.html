<p><strong>COMPLETE WWE SURVIVOR SERIES PPV COVERAGE</strong></p>
<p>By Mike Johnson on 2010-11-21 20:59:00</p>
<p>Todd Grisham interviewed Jack Swagger. He said that he should be the captain because he’s the only former World champion. He ripped on Miami, saying they were in Little Cuba, not Miami. Cod Rhodes cut in saying that Swagger was mad he couldn’t get into any hot clubs last night. Alberto Del Rio cut them off and said what they were doing was boring and that wasn’t why they were here. He said they were here to destroy Rey Mysterio, Del Rio said he wanted to see little kids cry because their hero was destroyed. He said that when they were done, he would buy them the beers. He said that they had nothing to fear because Alberto Del Rio was their captain. He walked off, leaving Cody and Swagger last to leave. Rhodes said that he hates to admit it but Del Rio is good.</p>
<p><strong>Team Mysterio (Rey Mysterio, Big Show, Kofi Kingston, MVP &amp; Chris Masters) vs. Team Del Rio (Alberto Del Rio, Drew McIntyre, Cody Rhodes, Jack Swagger &amp; Tyler Reks) in a Survivor Series elimination match</strong></p>
<p>The crowd is into MVP, big-time, since it’s his hometown. Rey and Del Rio start but Del Rio begs off to mess with his head and tags in to Rhodes. Rhodes caught Mysterio with a kick off the ropes, which they called the Disaster Kick. Del Rio then tagged in since Rey was down. He begaqn kicking and stomping the hell out of Rey.</p>
<p>Del Rio whipped Rey into the corner but Rey came out with a Lucha headscissors takedown. He snapped Del Rio into the corner with a drop toehold and dropkicked him. MVP tagged in to a big pop and worked over Del Rio. MVP ducked a kick to the head and drilled him into the buckles.</p>
<p>Kofi Kingston tagged in and came off with an elbow. Masters tagged in but Del Rio got the better of him. Reks and Drew each took turns working over Masters. Drew nailed him with a clothesline. Fans began chanting for Big Show. Masters made the tag to MVP who cleaned house on Drew. He nailed the Ballin’ elbow but Del Rio distracted him so MVP nailed him. MVP suplexed Drew from the outside into the ring but Del Rio hooked him leg and held it.</p>
<p>Drew pinned MVP, who is eliminated.</p>
<p>It’s not 5 vs. 4 with Team Del Rio getting the advantage.</p>
<p>MVP got a big chant on the way out.</p>
<p>Masters and Del Rio went back and forth. Masters went for the Masterlock but Del Rio escaped and nailed the rolling armbreaker. Masters tapped.</p>
<p>Masters is eliminated. It’s 5 vs. 3 with Del Rio having the advantage.</p>
<p>Show hits the ring , so Del Rio tagged out to Swagger. Swagger was able to take Show down and tagged back out to Del Rio. Del Rio slapped Show in the head, which only pissed Show off. Del Riop tagged out to Drew and mocked Show, saying he couldn’t get him because now he wasn’t the legal man. Show nailed him with the KO Punch anyway.</p>
<p>Show grabbed Drew and slammed him into the ring. Trainers rolled Del Rio off the apron. Show clotheslined Drew. He tagged in Kofi and slammed Kofi onto Drew for a two count. Trainers carried a dazed Del Rio from ringside. McIntyre tagged Rhodes. Kofi slapped him twice and Rhodes had a conniption fit over being hit in the face, kicking the stairs and the barricade before checking his face in a mirror.</p>
<p>Back in the ring, Kofi slapped him again, then tagged in Show, who KO’d Cody and pinned him. Entertaining as hell so far.</p>
<p>Rhodes is eliminated. 4 vs. 3 with Del Rio having the technical advantage, although Del Rio has left the scene.</p>
<p>Reks and Swagger worked on isolating Show from his partners. Swagger worked on Show’s leg. Swagger went for a forward rollthrough pin and came up locking Show in an anklelock. Show was able to tag in Rey, who nailed a Thesz Press off the ropes for a two count. Swagger came back with a big boot for a two count. Rey went for the 619 but Swagger was playing dead, catching Rey’s legs and locking in an ankle lock. Mysterio spun himself out. Swagger tagged Reks while Rey tagged Kofi.</p>
<p>Kofi went nuts with a ton of hot offense and drilled Reks with a kick. He nailed a flying bodypress but Reks kicks up. Kingston nailed a dropkick but Reks tied him to the tree of woe. He charged Kofi, who nailed him and rolled up Reks for a pinfall.</p>
<p>It’s 3 vs. 3.</p>
<p>Swagger and Kofi went back and forth. Swagger missed the Doctor Bomb. Kofi went for the Trouble in Paradise kick but was caught and turned into the anklelock. Kofi tapped.</p>
<p>Kingston is eliminated, so it’s 3 vs. 2 with Del Rio having the technical advantage.</p>
<p>Show and Mysterio took out Swagger. Rey went to Show’s shoulders to dive off of but Drew kicked Show’s leg out from under him and Rey crashed and burned. Swagger worked over Rey, getting near falls, but Rey came back for the 619. Rey went back to Show’s shoulders and dove off of them for a splash, pinning Swagger.</p>
<p>It’s 2 vs. 2, although no sign of Del Rio.</p>
<p>Drew went for Future Shock on Rey but Show was the legal man. He goozled and chokeslammed Drew, scoring the pin.</p>
<p>They announced Show and Mysterio as the sole survivors.</p>
<p>Your winners, Team Mysterio.</p>
<p>Really fun match. This is a great show so far.</p>

<p><strong>Complete WWE Smackdown Taping Results (SPOILERS)</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Jeremy Thomas on 10.08.2013</p>
<p>Michael Cole and JBL were introduced individually. JBL got some cheers, while Cole was booed mostly. A Raw recap of Big Show and Stephanie McMahon&rsquo;s segment and then of the main event.</p>
<p>Vickie Guerrero was introduced by Lilian Garcia. A recap of Vickie and Alberto Del Rio&rsquo;s kiss was shown followed by the John Cena announcement. Vickie called Big Show a deviant, saying he needed to be fired a long time ago. She said 12 hours later there was already a for sale sign in front of Big Show&rsquo;s house since he is unemployed.</p>
<p>Del Rio interrupted her and asked to get out of title match against John Cena. She said she would reconsider if he kisses her on lips. ADR kissed her on lips for a few seconds. She said now he needs to kiss her on (points to butt).</p>
<p>Damien Sandow interrupted and told Vickie that ADR thinks he can manipulate his way to defending title against Cena because ADR knows he will lose. Vickie made a match between Sandow and ADR. Del Rio hit Sandow with the mic and beat him down. Sandow got back up as ADR left. Sandow&rsquo;s music played&hellip;</p>
<p>World Hvt. Champion Alberto Del Rio beat Damien Sandow. A USA chant broke out but it didn&rsquo;t seem like the crowd was behind either at the time. They eventually warmed up to Sandow and cheered for him as the match progressed. Del Rio won by submission with the Cross Arm Breaker.</p>
<p>Dark Matches</p>
<p>Vickie Guerrero interrupted and announced a 20-man battle royal with winner of main event to face ADR in main event.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bray Wyatt won a 20-man battle royal. The 20 participants were all on the card from earlier on Smackdown and the Main Event taping. The final four were the Wyatt&rsquo;s and Titus O&rsquo;Neil. Eventually, Harper and Rowan left the ring, allowing Bray to win.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bray Wyatt defeated World Hvt. Champion Alberto Del Rio via count out. Del Rio jumped out of the ring and ran from Harper and Rowan until he was counted out. The Wyatts beat ADR down in ring. Sandow came out wanting to cash in his Money in the Bank contract. The Wyatt&rsquo;s beat him down as well to prevent it. The crowd cheered Sandow in the ring after this. He held up the case and Lilian announced him as still MITB holder. I&rsquo;m not sure if this night was designed as a face turn for Sandow or not, but the crowd was behind him. This concluded the taping.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>LIVE NOTES FROM LAST NIGHT&rsquo;S SMACKDOWN TAPING</strong></p>
<p>By Michael Mouser on 2013-10-09 08:49:12</p>
<p>just got home from the Smackdown tapings in Columbus, Ohio. I just wanted to add a couple of things to your spoilers:</p>
<p>The Building was nowhere near a sellout. ALL of the upper deck was tarped off, half of the middle level, AND a section in the lower bowl. It was a little depressing.</p>
<p>The team that Los Matadors defeated was actually Ricardo Rodriguez and Tyson Kidd dressed up as luchadors.</p>
<p>Sandow was WAY over with this crowd. In competition for the biggest pop of the night. The match he and Del Rio had is really a must see. Those 2 worked their asses off.</p>
<p>After the dark main, Del Rio was laid out with Sister Abigail and then Sandow ran out to tease a cash in. He was laid out as well. Everyone Left except Sandow and the night ended with him getting a standing ovation as he made his way to the back.</p>
<p>Pops: 1.) Cody Rhodes &amp; Goldust 2.) Damien Sandow 3.) R-Truth</p>
<p>Heat: 1.) Vickie 2.) Del Rio 3.) Axel w/Heymen</p>

<p><strong>Live Notes And Reactions From SmackDown</strong></p>
<p>By Chris Featherstone | October 11, 2013</p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s SmackDown show was presented from the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, OH. Here are some of the live notes from the show.</p>
<p>Many people was not aware of WWE touring overseas, which gave the live crowd a very limited number of talent to work with as seen on SmackDown. CM Punk was advertised to appear, but did not.</p>
<p>The audience was a bit puzzled at the Alberto Del Rio/Damien Sandow exchange, seeing how both of them are heels. However, during the match, Sandow started to receive more cheers.</p>
<p>Dark Match</p>
<p>The 20-man battle royal was incredibly fast. Unquestionably the fastest battle royal I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It lasted all of 5-7 minutes, with the last four being Titus O&rsquo;Neil and the Wyatt Family. When O&rsquo;Neil was eliminated, Bray commanded Rowan and Harper to eliminate themselves.</p>
<p>This lead to the World Heavyweight Championship match between Wyatt and Alberto Del Rio. The crowd was not into this match whatsoever. Similar to the disinterest that two heels are fighting each other as ADR and Sandow did during the show, but neither Wyatt nor ADR received hardly any reaction. Sandow coming out and teasing a cash-in after the Wyatt Family laid out ADR create a small reaction from the live crowd, but it quickly faded when they also laid out Sandow.</p>
<p>When Sandow got up, he walked up to the stage area and raised up his MITB briefcase to spark a reaction, in which he got an affirmative one. It appears as if WWE will be using more dark match main events to shape up Sandow&rsquo;s potential babyface run.</p>
<p>Overall, decent show, barring the absence of most of the main event talent.</p>

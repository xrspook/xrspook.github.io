<p><strong>Christopher Daniels vs Alberto El Patron - Sat, Jan 3rd</strong></p>
<p>The Fairgrounds - Nashville, TN - 7pm Bell Time</p>
<p>ALBERTO EL PATRON is debuting in Ring of Honor! This international superstar has traveled the globe amassing championships and accolades, but now it&rsquo;s time for him to take on the greatest professional wrestlers on the planet! Ever since the announcement that El Patron would be headed to ROH, Head Matchmaker Nigel McGuinness has been inundated with phone calls, texts, and emails from every single athlete in the locker room. Each man wants a shot at El Patron, and there nearly limitless combinations of potential matchups for his ROH tenure. Over the next few days, ROHwrestling.com will be releasing information on who McGuinness has selected to face El Patron in his first ROH matches. But signed for Nashville on January 3rd&hellip;</p>
<p>ALBERTO EL PATRON VS. &ldquo;THE FALLEN ANGEL&rdquo; CHRISTOPHER DANIELS!</p>
<p>This is a first time ever match against a Ring of Honor original! Since returning to ROH, The Fallen Angel has been reinvigorated and ready to take on absolutely anyone from anywhere. The Addiction has made a huge impact on the ROH tag team division, but Daniels is also pursuing a singles career and having stellar matches against the best in Ring of Honor. Nigel McGuinness couldn&rsquo;t think of a better introduction to our elite roster than &ldquo;The Fallen Angel&rdquo; Christopher Daniels!</p>
<p>Daniels is one of the most well-rounded athletes in all of professional wrestling. He refuses to limit himself and that makes him an especially challenging opponent. Daniels can match anyone hold-for-hold, but he&rsquo;s not afraid to take to the sky either! This long tenured veteran has emerged as one of the most respected and successful professional wrestlers competing today, an athlete whose experience and savvy might be unmatched within the ROH locker room. According to Nigel McGuinness, all of these qualities made him the ideal &ldquo;welcoming committee&rdquo; for Alberto El Patron in Ring of Honor. On January 3rd, you will have the privilege of watching two of the best do what they love in front of the greatest fans on the planet!</p>
<p>Alberto El Patron&rsquo;s hybrid style combines MMA training with an eclectic mix of Mexican and American pro wrestling techniques. For years, El Patron has stood out as an exceptional talent against anyone who faced him. But any wrestling fan couldn&rsquo;t help but think: what if he had the chance to take on ANYONE in professional wrestling, unrestricted and unrestrained? Finally, that day has arrived. El Patron has been making waves since returning to competition in Mexico, recently securing the AAA Heavyweight Championship. Crowds around the world have exploded every time he makes his entrance. So you know that January 3rd in Nashville is guaranteed to be a very special night for anyone in attendance!</p>
<p>In addition to a stellar live event featuring the ROH debut of Alberto El Patron, January 3rd is also a taping for ROH TV! Our cameras will be rolling to capture everything that goes down while we kick of 2015. Whether you&rsquo;re in the crowd or behind the scenes, the verdict is unanimous: 2014 was the biggest year ever for Ring of Honor&rsquo;s growth and global exposure. But we promise that 2015 will be even bigger! Starting off with the TOP PROSPECT TOURNAMENT and the debut of ALBERTO EL PATRON, 2015 has gotten rolling before it&rsquo;s even officially started! You need to be there LIVE on January 3rd when Ring of Honor returns to Nashville. For tickets to our very first TV taping of the year, click HERE!</p>

<p><strong>FIRST TIME EVER - ACH VS ALBERTO EL PATRÓN</strong></p>
<p>Fri, January 30th - Dearborn, Michigan</p>
<p>THE ROH WINTER WARRIORS TOUR is stopping in Dearborn! On January 30th, we make our return to the Ford Community &amp; Performing Arts Center in Dearborn, Michigan. Not only will you see your favorite ROH stars in action, this event will feature ALBERTO EL PATRÓN! International superstar Alberto El Patrón is headed to ROH to test his skills against the best professional wrestlers on the planet. We already know that in his debut, El Patrón will face &ldquo;The Fallen Angel&rdquo; Christopher Daniels!</p>
<p>The pressure is on ROH Head Matchmaker Nigel McGuinness to select opponents for El Patrón. These are coveted opportunities for first time ever &ldquo;dream&rdquo; matches! The Ring of Honor roster boasts such a diverse mix of styles and techniques that virtually any combination versus Alberto El Patrón is sure to get the professional wrestling world buzzing! On January 3rd in Nashville, El Patrón takes on the veteran Daniels. But on January 30th in Dearborn, McGuinness has signed a match featuring one the hungriest young breakout stars in Ring of Honor&hellip;</p>
<p>ALBERTO EL PATRÓN VS. ACH!</p>
<p>One of the undisputedly most exciting athletes in the history of ROH, ACH is fueled by heart and motivation. And what&rsquo;s more motivational than the opportunity to take on an international champion with years of global success? 2014 was full of huge matches for ACH, including TV and World Title opportunities and a show-stealing performance in the year&rsquo;s CHAMPIONS VS. ALL STARS bout. Even if he didn&rsquo;t come out holding gold, ACH showed the world that he is a force in ROH - now and for the future. His 2015 is kicking off with a World TV Title Triple Threat match and now he&rsquo;s set to face Alberto El Patrón!</p>
<p>And how do you prepare for a match against ACH? El Patrón has traveled the world wrestling professionally for a decade and a half. He&rsquo;s trained extensively in Mexico and Japan. But we can guarantee he&rsquo;s never faced anyone quite like ACH! That&rsquo;s because night after night ACH thrills crowds with athletic feats unlike anyone else in this sport. Can El Patrón utilize his extensive technical and submission background to keep ACH grounded?</p>

<p><strong>MR ROH takes on EL PATRÓN in Dayton!</strong></p>
<p>Sat Jan 31st - Montgomery County Fairgrounds</p>
<p>ALBERTO EL PATRÓN is making his Ring of Honor debut in 2015! Our biggest year ever is kicking off with some first time matches you aren&rsquo;t going to see anywhere else. Alberto El Patrón is an international superstar whose accolades (and championships) span the globe. Renowned for a hybrid style combining Lucha Libre, mixed martial arts, and other diverse fighting techniques, El Patrón comes equipped to take absolutely anyone to the limit. The entire ROH roster has been campaigning for the opportunity to face El Patrón in these matches. ROH Head Matchmaker Nigel McGuinness has taken every request into consideration and carefully evaluated the options. It&rsquo;s definitely not a simple task: virtually any combination could steal the show!</p>
<p>We already know that El Patrón will face &ldquo;The Fallen Angel&rdquo; Christopher Daniels on January 3rd in Nashville. And on January 30th in Dearborn, he faces the challenge of ACH! Today we can confirm Alberto El Patrón&rsquo;s opponent for January 31st when the ROH WINTER WARRIORS TOUR rolls into Dayton&hellip;</p>
<p>ALBERTO EL PATRÓN VS. RODERICK STRONG!</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t come to Ring of Honor without wrestling &ldquo;Mr. ROH&rdquo;! Cocky and confident, Roderick Strong considers himself the most loyal, most iconic star in ROH. And when you look at his accomplishments, it&rsquo;s really difficult to argue against him! Roderick Strong might talk a lot of trash, but he also has the resume to back it up. It&rsquo;s often stated that Roderick Strong is the &ldquo;gatekeeper&rdquo; of ROH. He is the standard for excellence for anyone who hopes to compete in Ring of Honor - and he has been guarding the ranks for years. Strong, only the second Triple Crown Champion in ROH history, has made major claims that 2015 will be his year. He is motivated by a deep desire to prove that he the very best in the world, inside that ring. Having faced off with every major name in Ring of Honor history, from Bryan Danielson to Samoa Joe, Strong is no stranger to top level competition. With his eyes on winning gold in ROH in 2015, a win over the international superstar El Patrón, could put him in top contention to any championship.</p>
<p>The Mexican Aristocrat, El Patrón requested nothing but the very best from ROH matchmaker Nigel McGuinness. This match-up with Strong gives him not only one of the best today, but one of the best in Ring of Honor history! With a storied legacy of his own in Mexico, Japan and the US, can Alberto defeat “Mr. ROH” to add to it? The fans of Dayton will find out for sure.</p>
<p>Of course, El Patrón is world famous for his submission technique. He has seemingly limitless ways to trap an arm and make his opponents tap out. But while Roderick Strong might stand out for his speed and relentlessness, you can&rsquo;t discount his abilities as a submissions specialist himself. The Strong Hold remains one of the most inescapable, devastating techniques in Ring of Honor. Strong has used it to win match after match, time after time. As recently as FINAL BATTLE, he overcame Adam Page with the Strong Hold.<br>
It is Roderick Strong’s take no prisoners, fast pace, aggressive style against Alberto’s dangerous array of submissions. Each man has something to prove to the other. Both men have something to prove the fans of Ring of Honor.</p>
<p>Two World class athletes collide in a dream match that you are only going to see in Ring of Honor, on January 31st. And you can be there too when the ROH WINTER WARRIORS TOUR stops in Dayton, Ohio! We will have more news about matches and other information right here at ROHwrestling.com.

<p><strong>COMPLETE WWE RAW 1008 REPORT: NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS REMATCH; SMACKDOWN REMATCH; MAIN EVENTS COMBINED INTO A TAG MATCH; MIZTV DEBUTS; THE TAG TEAM DIVISION HEATS UP; UPDATES ON JERRY LAWLER; AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUT JBL, JIM ROSS, AND MICHAEL COLE TOGETHER ON COMMENTARY</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-09-17 21:21:03</p>
<p>We are live from Bridgeport, Connecticut and your announcers are Michael ‘I guess I will play the straight man again’ Cole, John ‘Not the same as being on television with Jonathan Hoenig and Wayne Rogers’ Layfield, and Jim ‘Back in the saddle again’ Ross.</p>
<p>CM Punk’s music plays and Paul Heyman makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Paul introduces himself and he says that he felt like everyone last night because at Night of Champions, he got to witness history in the most enormous fashion. He got to see CM Punk successfully defend the WWE Championship against John Cena.</p>
<p>Paul says that the ending is embroiled in controversy and everyone is talking about it. Paul says that in the interest of clarity, he wants the referee, Chad Patton, to come out to defend his decision to the entire WWE audience.</p>
<p>Paul thanks Chad for coming out and he shows Chad a photo of the end of the match with both men’s shoulders down.</p>
<p>Paul says that everyone is on Chad’s case and there is no bigger critic than John Cena. Paul says that Chad did not make the wrong decision. He made the right decision.</p>
<p>Chad agrees with Paul.</p>
<p>Paul says that he and CM Punk congratulate him for making that decision. Paul says that there is more evidence to vindicate Chad. Paul mentions that someone posted footage from a camera phone on YouTube, but that video was taken down and Paul blames John Cena.</p>
<p>Paul wonders what more needs to be seen. The match was a tie and the tie goes to the champion. The match is a draw and the match goes to the champion. That means that CM Punk is the WWE Champion for a 303rd day.</p>
<p>Paul says that CM Punk is now worthy of the fan’s respect and the people are not giving it to him. Punk walked into Boston last night . . .</p>
<p>and Paul is interrupted by John Cena’s music.</p>
<p>John tells Paul to shut up when Paul starts to talk. He says that he agrees with Paul. Chad made the right call last night. John says that he did not take down the video. Chad is a known and respected official and he knows that Chad would have no bias against him.</p>
<p>John talked to Chad after the match. It was not about the decision, but it was about the finality of the decision. The match last night was epic and it built to a match of Wrestlemania proportions. When Chad explained that the match was a draw, he says that is like ending the Super Bowl in a tie.</p>
<p>John says that everyone wanted to see who would have won that epic match. Cena asks Chad if a draw is how he wanted to see that match end.</p>
<p>John says that Paul has been a CM Punk supporter and Punk has always clamored for respect. Last night, to retain the title in a tie? Did CM Punk earn the respect that he has been seeking.</p>
<p>Paul tells John ‘Yes’.</p>
<p>Cena says that the people agree with him and the definition of respect that Paul and Punk have is different than his.</p>
<p>Respect is not hitting someone with a belt after winning a match by a tie. It means beating anyone on any given night to say that you are the Best in the World. Respect is being able to hold your head high after a definitive decision.</p>
<p>John says that he wants to know who the winner is going to be. John says that he will do it on one leg. Cena says that he wants to relive Night of Champions and all they need is CM Punk.</p>
<p>Paul says that CM Punk will be happy to tell Cena to his face what he thinks of the challenge, but Punk will tells Cena . . . when he gets here.</p>
<p>Paul says that he is the voice of the voice of the voice of the voiceless.</p>
<p>Before we get Paul’s answer on behalf of Punk, we are interrupted by the man who lost the World Title Match, Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez).</p>
<p>Alberto tells Cena to stop crying about last night. He had his chance and he lost. Del Rio says that he never got a first chance. The Brogue Kick was banned two weeks ago and then suddenly from nowhere, it was reinstated before his title match.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he was not ready for his match at Night of Champions and he deserves his rematch.</p>
<p>AJ Lee comes to the ring as any General Manager would, she skips to the ring.</p>
<p>AJ says that on behalf of Booker T, they both deserve second chances. AJ will combine the main events from last night to make a Super Main Event. CM Punk and Alberto Del Rio will face Sheamus and John Cena. The winner might go a long way towards determining if there will be a rematch for either of them.</p>
<p>AJ skips out of the ring and Paul tries to catch up to her.</p>
<p>We are back and CM Punk and Paul Heyman are talking in the back. David Otunga tells Punk that on behalf of Alberto Del Rio, he expects Punk to follow Del Rio. Paul reminds David that Punk has been champion for 303 days so he follows nobody’s lead.</p>
<p>David tells Heyman that it looks like Punk sleeps in a cardboard box. Otunga slurps some coffee while Paul and Punk talk. Paul suggests that Del Rio should get a time machine to go back to last year’s Survivor Series when Punk beat Del Rio for the title.</p>
<p>Punk tells Del Rio that he is looking forward to teaming with him. Del Rio says that it is an honor.</p>
<p>Match Number Nine: Sheamus and John Cena versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) and CM Punk (with Paul Heyman)</p>
<p>Cena and Punk start things off but they never lock up and Punk tags in Del Rio. Punk talks to Heyman about something. Del Rio has something to say to Punk before locking up with Cena.

<p>By Jason Zohn on 2013-01-30 03:41:29</p>
<p>Smackdown opened with a number of contenders in the ring as Booker T came out to the ring. In the ring were Team Hell No, Sheamus, Randy Orton, Dolph Ziggler and The Great Khali. They show ckips of the World champion Alberto Del Rio stalking outside with a bat, looking for Big Show to get him back for what he did to Ricardo on Raw. Booker said that they are all former champions and deserve another chance to become World champions. He announces they are in the Elimination Chamber. Out comes Jack Swagger in his first TV appearance since 1959 it seems, who says he&rsquo;s a former World champion and should be in the Chamber too, so he&rsquo;s going to go an win it. Booker says there are only six pods. Dolph says he already has a guaranteed title shot (Money in the Bank) so he&rsquo;s pulling out. Booker tells him he might want to chicken out but he&rsquo;s not chickening out of a match tonight with Alberto. Everyone else has to prove themselves tonight with their performances.</p>

<p>They show Rock and Punk from Raw.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio warns Ricardo he is to stay backstage.</p>
<p>World champion Alberto Del Rio defeated Dolph Ziggler in a really great main event. Pretty sure this was a non-title bout. Ziggler was over in San Diego. AJ and Langston got involved and thrown out. AJ sure lost her momentum compared to last time they were in town. Ziggler works over Del Rio who makes a comeback. They have a lot of good near falls but Del Rio finally grabs him in the armbreaker for the win.</p>
<p>Big Show shows up on the screen having grabbed Ricardo and knocks him out. That closes the show.</p>

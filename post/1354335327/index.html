<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: WILL THE BRIEFCASE BE ON THE LINE?; SIX MAN TAG ACTION; DAMIEN SANDOW TRIES TO EDUCATE THE MASSES; I THINK WE KNOW THE MAIN EVENT FOR RAW OR SMACKDOWN NEXT WEEK</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-11-30 21:58:43</p>
<p>Tonight on Smackdown, will The Shield continue their attack on the WWE? Will Ryback do something on this week’s show? What will Sheamus do this week to prepare for his World Title Match against Big Show at TLC? It looks like he will be facing Dolph Ziggler.</p>
<p>This week, Smackdown is in Bossier City, Louisiana and your announcers are John ‘Flash Flood’ Layfield and Josh ‘Day After Tomorrow in the Locker Room’ Mathews.</p>
<p>John Cena makes his way to the ring to take the traditional promo segment to start off Smackdown spot.</p>
<p>In case you missed Raw, John Cena faced Dolph Ziggler and John’s knee gave out again. We then saw Vickie Guerrero and AJ Lee get involved. Ziggler fell victim to the Attitude Adjustment and John Cena won the match.</p>
<p>John says that he wants the world to know that this is Smackdown. He says that something seems mysterious. He is John Cena and not one of the regulars on Smackdown. He is excited for the main event on this week’s show. Mr. Money in the Bank Dolph Ziggler will be involved. There is a reason why he is focusing on Dolph Ziggler. It is because Dolph is busy poking fingers into his business.</p>
<p>John says that he is poking his fingers into Dolph’s business tonight. Dolph’s greatest accomplishment is being the World Champion . . . for two minutes. A glorious one hundred twenty seconds. Dolph’s biggest fear, other than everyone finding out that he is a man stuck in a teenage girl’s body, is losing the Money in the Bank briefcase. As that case goes, so does his identity. He hides behind the power of Vickie Guerrero and says that he can hang with the top superstars in the WWE.</p>
<p>On Monday, Dolph got to test that by facing on him Raw. John reminds us that Dolph lost that match. The reason why he is here tonight, it is because Dolph is not in a match, he is in a fight. Dolph will have to survive a match with Sheamus.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio’s music plays and he makes his way to the ring. Alberto tells Cena that he shouldn’t be worried about Dolph Ziggler. Cena should be worried about him because this is his house and his show.</p>
<p>Cena says that this is a WWE broadcast so the show belongs to the WWE Universe.</p>
<p>Alberto says that Smackdown is his show and he calls Cena a gringo estupido. Alberto wants to know if he has to remind Cena that he is a former Money in the Bank briefcase holder, or a Royal Rumble winner, or a former two time WWE Champion?</p>
<p>Alberto tells Cena that the last time they met in the ring, he destroyed Cena. Alberto tells Cena to leave his show and his ring . . . right now.</p>
<p>John thinks about it for a moment and he says that he did not forget those things. John does not want to go because he has a match with Alberto Del Rio and it is right now.</p>
<p>Cena punches Del Rio and Alberto goes to the floor.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number One: John Cena versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez)</strong></p>
<p>They lock up and Del Rio with a side head lock. Cena with a hip toss and Del Rio goes to the floor to discuss strategy with Ricardo. Del Rio drops Cena on the top rope and Del Rio kicks Cena in the ribs and Cena goes to the floor. Del Rio kicks Cena in the ribs and then he sends Cena into the announce table. Del Rio goes up top and he connects with an axe handle for a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio with kicks to Cena in the corner. Cena with kicks and punches but Del Rio with a hard Irish whip. Del Rio with a boot to the back of the neck. Del Rio mocks Cena and then he kicks him again. Del Rio with a running boot to the head. Del Rio with a suplex and he gets a near fall.</p>
<p>We see Dolph Ziggler watching on the monitor in the back.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a chin lock and arm bar. Del Rio turns it into an arm bar. Del Rio with a knee and kick. Cena blocks a suplex and Cena with a suplex of his own. Cena misses a charge into the corner and Cena’s shoulder hits the ring post. Del Rio with a running kick to the ribs. Del Rio wraps Cena’s arm in the rope to prepare for the cross arm breaker.</p>
<p>Del Rio goes up top with an axe handle and he gets a near fall. Del Rio with a kick to the shoulder and he applies a top wrist lock. We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Del Rio misses a back senton when Cena moves out of the way. Cena with two flying shoulder tackles followed by the Blue Thunder Bomb and then it is time for the five knuckle shuffle and he hits it. Cena gets Del Rio up for the Attitude Adjustment but Del Rio escapes and he hits a lungblower for a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a kick to the midsection. Del Rio signals that he is getting ready for the cross arm breaker. Del Rio tries for the float over but Cena counters with a neck breaker and both men are down. Cena goes up top but Del Rio recovers and hits the step up enzuigiri but only gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio misses a step up enzuigiri in the corner and Cena tries for the STF. Del Rio avoids it and hits a tilt-a-whirl back breaker. Del Rio with a kick to the ribs and then he goes up top. Del Rio tries for a third time from the top but Cena counters with a drop kick and both men are down.</p>
<p>Cena gets Del Rio on his shoulders but Del Rio escapes and he floats over and applies the cross arm breaker. Cena escapes and applies the STF but Del Rio is able to get to the ropes and Cena has to release the hold. Del Rio goes to the apron and Del Rio applies the cross arm breaker in the ropes and has to release the hold on four.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a kick to the shoulder and he slingshots back in but Cena gets Del Rio on his shoulders. Del Rio escapes and hits a German suplex and bridge for a near fall. Del Rio puts Cena on the top turnbuckles and he puts Cena in the tree of woe. Del Rio with kicks and then he chokes Cena. Del Rio misses a charge into the corner and Del Rio hits the ring post.</p>
<p>Cena goes up top and hits the Rocker Dropper for the three count.</p>
<p>Winner: John Cena</p>
<p>After the match, Dolph Ziggler attacks John Cena on the stage with the briefcase.</p>

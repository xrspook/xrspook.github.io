<p><strong>WWE MAIN EVENT REPORT: DOES RYBACK FEED ON SOMETHING MEXICAN TONIGHT?; WAS 3MB SCREWED OUT OF PERFORMING TWICE IN CONCERT THIS WEEK?; A HANDICAP MATCH; AN EPIC TRIBUTE TO ALBERTO IS INTERRUPTED; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-12-12 19:40:05</p>
<p>Tonight, there is nothing to recap before Main Event starts.</p>
<p>Main Event is in Bridgeport, Connecticut this week and your announcers are Michael ‘Is there some numerical coincidence today’ Cole and The Miz.</p>
<p>Miz and Michael Cole are in the ring and the ring is surrounded by tables, ladders, and chairs because there is a pay per view on Sunday.</p>
<p>Michael asks Miz if he can believe that we are a few days away from the final pay per view of the year. Miz says that the complexion of the show has changed. Miz mentions the Shield and Cole says that they will talk about the Shield throughout the show.</p>
<p>Cole mentions that the main event on Main Event is Alberto Del Rio against Ryback.</p>
<p>We take a look at Ryback with a video package. We see Ryback seconds away from winning the WWE Championship . . . until The Shield hit the ring and sent Ryback through a table. We see the next set of interactions between Ryback and The Shield. Remember that Daniel Bryan and Kane will be Ryback’s tag team partner on Sunday at TLC.</p>
<p>Miz mentions that CM Punk suffered a knee injury at the hands of Ryback. Cole reminds us that we have a six man tag match at TLC as a result.</p>
<p>Ricardo Rodriguez interrupts and he says that it is time for the people to see what they want. They will see a real competitor who deserves to be in the main event . . . Alberto Del Rio. Ricardo says that everyone is excited and he is excited to see a true master of the art. Ricardo says that he has taken the time to put together a small, tiny, little seventeen minute video tribute to the greatest sports entertainer.</p>
<p>Ricardo asks himself how he can fit all of Alberto’s accomplishments into a seventeen minute video, but he was able to do it. He introduces the video for the man, the myth, the legend, and his best friend . . . Albertoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Del Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrio.</p>
<p>We see footage showing Alberto as the Greatest Man Alive. He is a third generation superstar from Mexico and greatness runs through is veins. Alberto says that it is his destiny to be the greatest.</p>
<p>We see a series of Alberto’s vehicles that he drove into the arena before his matches and promos. It is your pleasure to see the essence of Alberto Del Rio as he faces people who tarnish his greatness. He is filthy rich, talented, devoted, handsome, invaluable, a treasure, a stallion of the arts . . .</p>
<p>For no reason, Ryback’s music plays and he goes onto the stage. As he makes his way to the ring, Ricardo goes to the floor and hides behind Cole and Miz.</p>
<p>Alberto calls Ryback an ignorant animal with no brains. He interrupted a tribute to the greatest man in WWE history. He says that he is going to teach Ryback a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number One: Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) versus Ryback</strong></p>
<p>They lock up and they go into the corner. Del Rio with a kick and punch but Ryback presses Del Rio over his head and he drops Del Rio behind him. Del Rio rolls to the floor and Ricardo checks on Alberto as we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Del Rio with head butts to Ryback and then he tries for a suplex but Ryback blocks it. Ryback with a delayed vertical suplex on Del Rio while Ricardo tells Ryback to put him down. Ryback with an Irish whip and back elbow to Del Rio. Ryback with a head butt and punch to Del Rio.</p>
<p>Ryback sends Del Rio into the turnbuckles and then he Irish whips Del Rio and Del Rio goes down. Ryback keeps Ricardo away from Del Rio but Del Rio is able to get to the floor. Ryback pulls Del Rio into the ring by the head and he drives Del Rio to the mat and gets a near fall. Del Rio with a back heel kick and a kick to the head.</p>
<p>Del Rio with more kicks to the head as he tries to ground Ryback. Del Rio with a leaping boot to the back. Ryback with a Thesz Press and then he picks Del Rio up by the neck and sends him to the mat. Ryback slams Del Rio and then he hits a splash and gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio with punches and a kick followed by a drop kick to the head. Del Rio goes to the turnbuckles for a double sledge to the back. Del Rio with a punch to the head but Ryback punches back. Del Rio avoids a slam and then he moves out of the corner when Ryback charges into the corner. Ryback’s shoulder goes into the post and Del Rio puts the arm between the steps and the ring post. Del Rio kicks the steps to set up the arm for the cross arm breaker. We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Del Rio with a double sledge as he comes off the turnbuckles. Del Rio with a kick to the back and then Del Rio gets a near fall. Del Rio with an arm bar. Ryback with a belly-to-back suplex and both men are down. Ryback misses a splash into the corner and Ryback hits the turnbuckles with his sternum. Del Rio leaps onto Ryback’s chest and gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a kick and punches to Ryback. Del Rio chokes Ryback in the corner. Del Rio works on the neck but Ryback picks up Del Rio and pushes him off. Ryback with body blocks to Del Rio and then Ryback with a running power slam. Ryback gets set for the lariat but Del Rio rolls to the floor.</p>
<p>Ryback tries to suplex Del Rio back into the ring but Del Rio lands on his feet and he hits a knee breaker to the arm and then Del Rio with the step up enzuigiri to the back of the head and Del Rio gets a near fall. Del Rio with forearms to the shoulder and he sets for the cross arm breaker but Ryback sends Del Rio into the corner. Ryback winds up for the lariat and he connects.</p>
<p>Ryback says that it is over and he gets ready for the marching muscle buster. Ryback marches around and hits it for the three count.</p>
<p>Winner: Ryback</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Miz and Cole talk about Ryback’s performance tonight against Del Rio.</p>
<p>Matt Striker is in the locker room with Ryback. Matt congratulates Ryback on his victory and he wants to get Ryback’s thoughts on the TLC match. He came this far believing in Survival of the Fittest with one man atop the food chain. To beat the Shield, they will have to act like the shield. They must work together, breathe together, and feed together.</p>
<p>Matt asks Ryback if that is possible since he has acted like a lone wolf.</p>
<p>Ryback snarls in Matt’s face and he says Yes a few times and leaves.</p>

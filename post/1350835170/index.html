<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2010-09-17 22:00:04</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Detroit, Michigan and your announcers are Matt ‘I can see Canada from my window’ Striker and Todd ‘I know whose favorite place is TGI Fridays’ Grisham.</p>
<p>We will hear from Kane tonight to see if he is going to agree to the No Holds Barred stipulation. CM Punk will face Christian later tonight.</p>
<p>Christian will get some extra exposure tonight because he is in the ring for the Peep Show. Christian welcomes everyone to the Peep Show and before he can introduce his guest, he is interrupted by Ricardo Rodriguez who tells Christian that he is the only person who can introduce Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>Alberto shows off his smile for the people of Detroit. Christian welcomes him to the Peep Show and he says that Alberto has made quite the impression in his short time on Smackdown. He has his own ring announcer, he drives the great cars, has tailor made suits. He thinks he is seeing two different guys. There is the guy we see now and the guy we were exposed to in numerous boring and brutal videos. Christian wants to know if it is the guy who is great or the guy who is a cheap fajita . . . all sizzle no steak.</p>
<p>Alberto says that all you need to know about him is what he did to Rey Mysterio. Alberto says that was phenomenal. It tells him everything that Christian needs to know about him.</p>
<p>Christian says that he has been around the WWE for a long time and the WWE Universe knows Christian’s credentials. He has seen the next big thing, a pack of guys dress up like cheerleaders, and he has seen a guy who ate worms and thought he was the Boogeyman. Christian says that he has outlasted them all. He wants to know if Alberto is a flash in the pan or is he the Most Interesting Man in the World.</p>
<p>Alberto asks Christian if he thinks he is funny. He says that of course Christian has done everything because he is the great Christian. Alberto says that he is the man who will change Smackdown forever. He will bring pride to the Mexican people. He says that Christian will be cleaning his house.</p>
<p>Christian reminds Alberto that Rey is a good friend of his. He says that he has pride. Christian challenges Alberto to a match, fight, or whatever he wants at Night of Champions.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he does not think so. He says that if he faces Christian, he will end up like the rest of the people. He will be a peasant. He says that he likes Christian, but in a weird way. Alberto says that it is time for him to go and the interview is over. Alberto says that he will think about the match.</p>
<p>Christian gives him one to think about and he slaps Alberto in the face. Alberto takes off his jacket and scarf and instead of attacking Christian, he leaves the ring. Alberto says that he is done with Christian. He says that his answer is no.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio has joined Matt and Todd at the announce table. Matt is excited to have Alberto at the announce table with them and Todd wonders why Alberto is at the announce table. Matt asks Alberto about Christian and he says that Christian is a nobody and does not deserve to be in the ring with him. He says that Christian has no class. Todd wants to know when the time will be to accept his challenge and Alberto wonders why Todd is talking to him.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Four: CM Punk versus Christian</strong></p>
<p>Christian with a side head lock and shoulder tackle for a near fall. Shoulder with another shoulder tackle and he gets another near fall. Punk rolls to the ropes to stop Christian. They have a Greco Roman knuckle lock and Punk with a kick and punches. Christian with a punch to Punk and then he stands on Punk’s back and then he slingshots to the floor and connects with a punch. Punk with a knee to a charging Christian. Punk gets a near fall. Punk with a back breaker and he gets a near fall. Punk with a body scissors on Christian and he rakes the eyes. Christian escapes the hold but Punk kicks Christian away and then connects with a kick to the back of the head and gets a near fall. Christian with an elbow but Punk with a double sledge. Punk with a punch to the ribs and then he connects with an elbow to the head as he goes for Christian’s injured forehead. Punk tries for a suplex but Christian blocks it and punches Punk. Punk drops Christian on the ropes and then Punk with a springboard drop kick that knocks Christian to the floor and we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Punk with a body scissors and chin lock but Christian with elbows to Punk to get out of the hold. Punk tries for an abdominal stretch and Christian fights it off for a few seconds, but Punk is able to apply it. Punk gets a near fall and then he hits a back breaker as he continues to work on Christian’s back. Christian escapes a back breaker and then they both bump heads and they are down. They both get to their feet at nine and then Punk with a kick but Christian with a punch. They exchange punches and then Christian with a running forearm and he connects with a slap. Christian with the corkscrew back elbow from the turnbuckles and then Punk with a kick and he gets Christian up for the Go to Sleep but Christian escapes and he hits the sunset flip from the turnbuckles for a near fall. Christian tries for the Killswitch but Punk turns it into a rollup. They roll through a few times and Christian with a near fall. Punk with shoulders in the corner. Punk sets for the running knee into the corner and he connects and he tries for the bulldog but Christian hits an inverted DDT and gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Alberto gets on the mic and he says that he has reconsidered and that distraction allows Punk to hit the Go To Sleep and get the three count.</p>
<p>Winner: CM Punk</p>
<p>After the match, Alberto gets a chair and he brings it into the ring. Alberto puts the chair on top of Christian and chokes him while he tells Christian that his answer is still no.</p>
<p>Pyro goes off and Big Show comes to the ring. Punk gets out of the ring. Alberto and Show are in the ring. Alberto stands with the chair but it was a distraction to allow Punk to try to hit Show from behind. Punk with a kick and he goes for the knee in the corner but Show pushes him off and connects with the right hand and Punk is out.</p>

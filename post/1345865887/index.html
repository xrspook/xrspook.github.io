<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: WHO IS THE NUMBER ONE CONTENDER?; VIVA ZAPATOS; WILL WWE FINALLY CARE ABOUT THE TAG TEAM DIVISION; COME BACK SOON JOSH MATHEWS</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-08-24 22:00:50</p>
<p>We had controversy at SummerSlam during the World Title Match. What will happen tonight when Booker T addresses the situation on tonight’s show?</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Bakersfield, California and your announcers is Michael ‘Great, I get to break in a new announcer because Kane went crazy on Sunday’ Cole.</p>
<p>Randy Orton makes his way to the ring and he will have something to say to the people of Bakersfield. We see what happened on Monday night when Randy Orton got the win because of Sheamus’ involvement from ringside.</p>
<p>Randy tells us who he is. He says that he has never been a glass half full person. He likes to take the glass, smash it into a million pieces and then beat up the person who came up with the term. Randy says that he thrives on confrontation.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio says that he should mind his own business and that Randy’s win on Monday was tainted. Orton says that is too bad. He says that he deserves to face Sheamus for the World Championship.</p>
<p>Judging on how the internet and social media blew up based on what happened, he is sure that there are a few people who have a problem with what he is saying. Randy invites those people to come out to the ring right now and confront him.</p>
<p>Orton waits for a moment and the first person to accept the Randy Orton verbal challenge is the World Champion Sheamus and he is ready to talk. . . fella.</p>
<p>Sheamus tells Randy that he is not out here to disagree with him. He says that Bertie has had his chances and he has blown them time after time. On Raw, we saw Orton beat Bertie fair and square. At SummerSlam, he beat Del Rio fair and square. Sheamus says that Orton should be in the front of the line to face him and he wants Orton in the front of the line to face him for the World Championship.</p>
<p>Smackdown General Manager Booker T makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Booker wants them to put the brakes on because they are talking about something monster and huge. Randy Orton versus Sheamus for the World Championship. Booker asks the fans of they want to see it. Booker says that he wants to see it too.</p>
<p>Booker says that Randy has all of the credentials but he needs to talk about Monday night.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez join the party and he wants to know what Orton is doing in there because the title is his. Alberto tells Booker that Sheamus is a cheater and Orton is a crazy animal. Are those the type of people you want for the World Title?</p>
<p>Booker starts to speak and Alberto cuts him off. Alberto says that he should have been the World Champion by now because everyone knows that Sheamus cheated. The referee robbed him at SummerSlam. Then the next night, he was put in a match against Randy Orton and the only reason why Orton won because Sheamus cheated again.</p>
<p>Booker starts to talk and Alberto cuts him off again and he says that Booker doesn’t know anything. He wants to know if Booker is aware that Sheamus is a cheater and a thief.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he never lost the match because he was in control and he was destroying Sheamus. Alberto reminds Booker of the protest he filed and he says that he is waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>Randy says that Alberto is embarrassing himself.</p>
<p>Alberto says that there is a conspiracy and Booker is a cheater and criminal just like Sheamus. Alberto says that Booker, Sheamus, Orton, and everyone is against him.</p>
<p>Booker tells Alberto to calm down. Booker tells Randy that he will always be in line for a title shot, but the person who was in line next is Alberto Del Rio. That was until Alberto came out and ran his mouth. Booker says that he changed his mind. Tonight we will have a rematch from Raw between Alberto and Randy. The winner of the match will be the number one contender for the World Title.</p>
<p>Booker wants to know if we can dig that.</p>
<p>We go the back and Alberto is yelling at Ricardo and we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Sheamus has joined Michael at the announce table.</p>
<p>Match Number Six: Randy Orton versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) in a Number One Contender Match</p>
<p>They lock up and Del Rio with a side head lock and shoulder tackle for a near fall. Orton punches Del Rio and sends him into the turnbuckles and gets a near fall with a rollup. Orton kicks Del Rio and then he hits a slingshot suplex and gets a near fall. Orton with a boot to the lower abdomen. Orton with more boots to the midsection while Alberto is in the ropes.</p>
<p>Orton slingshots Del Rio into the bottom rope and Orton with a near fall. Del Rio with a kick to the arm and then he starts to work on the shoulder for the cross arm breaker. Del Rio sets for the float over into the cross arm breaker but Del Rio takes too much time and Orton with a swinging neck breaker and Del Rio goes to the floor. We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Del Rio with a reverse chin lock on Orton. During the commercial Orton has his arm slammed into the ring steps. Del Rio adds an arm bar to the chin lock. Orton with a punch and head butt to get free. Del Rio with a knee to the midsection. Del Rio with a kick and he gets a near fall. Del Rio with punches to the arm and then he locks in an arm bar.</p>
<p>Orton with punches to Del Rio but Del Rio with a knee and Irish whip. Del Rio tries for the step up enzuigiri but Orton ducks and Del Rio hits the mat. Orton with two clotheslines. Del Rio misses a clothesline and that means it is power slam time. Del Rio rolls to the apron and Orton tries for the IEDDT but Del Rio pulls Orton’s arm into the ropes.</p>
<p>Del Rio returns to the ring and Orton with a back breaker for a near fall. Del Rio with an arm breaker and he gets a near fall. Del Rio tries for the float over but Orton escapes. Del Rio with an elbow and he goes to the turnbuckles but Orton with a drop kick and both men are down. Orton with a near fall. Orton sends Del Rio to the apron and hits the IEDDT. Orton looks around and then he twist to the mat and pounds it to set up the RKO.</p>
<p>Del Rio holds on to the ropes to avoid the RKO. Del Rio rolls through into the cross arm breaker and Orton tries to get to the ropes but Orton has to tap out.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>After the match, Sheamus gets up from the announce table. Alberto pushes Ricardo down to get his shoe and he throws it at Sheamus. Sheamus goes into the ring and he takes Alberto down. Ricardo gets involved and he grabs Sheamus, allowing Del Rio to hit a round kick. Del Rio hits Sheamus in the head with Ricardo’s other shoe.</p>
<p>Dolph Ziggler’s music plays and he comes to the ring and he is going to cash in the briefcase, but before he can hand the case to the referee, Randy Orton hits an RKO on Ziggler.</p>

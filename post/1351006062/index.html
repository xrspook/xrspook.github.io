<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: PARTICIPANTS IN &lsquo;TRADITIONAL SURVIVOR SERIES MATCH&rsquo; THE FOCUS TONIGHT; NEW MATCH ANNOUNCED FOR SURVIVOR SERIES; DID EDGE GET INSIDE KANE&rsquo;S HEAD?</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2010-11-19 21:55:18</p>
<p>We begin with comments from Kane and Paul Bearer about his match with Edge at Survivor Series. He tells Kane that nothing can stop him. Then we hear Edge’s comments about his plan to become a Ten Time World Champion. Then Kane’s father went missing, only to be found by Edge who had him tied up in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Richmond, Virginia and your announcers are Matt ‘Gorilla Monsoon ’ Striker, Todd ‘Sean Mooney’ Grisham and Michael ‘Tony Schiavone’ Cole.</p>
<p>Tony Chimmel introduces Ricardo Rodriguez, who will introduce his ‘boss’ Alberto Del Rio. This time, Alberto does not have a chauffeur and he makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Alberto tells us his name, but we already know that. After 24 years, Survivor Series is going to be great. It is going to be great because the superstar of the show will be Alberto Del Rio. It will be great because he will lead Team Del Rio to victory. They will destroy Rey Mysterio and his little team. He says that Rey is not the only one who likes to be destroyed. Some people like to learn the hard way. Who better than Alberto to teach them a lesson. Just like he did on Raw. We see footage of Alberto Del Rio’s victory over Sergeant Slaughter on Monday night. We see Alberto’s post match attack and Montel Vontavious Porter coming to the aid of Sergeant Slaughter.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he made everyone’s little action figure, Sergeant Slaughter cry. Alberto says that when it comes to heroes, he is their hero.</p>
<p>Montel Vontavious Porter comes out and he says that Alberto doesn’t have a firm grasp of the English language, but the WWE Universe is telling him to punch Alberto Del Rio in the mouth because everyone is tired of Alberto disrespecting the ring and everything it stands for.</p>
<p>Alberto tells MVP that there is no one like him out there. Porter says that Alberto is a dime a dozen and he is too foolish to realize that it is the Sergeant Slaughters, the Chavo Classics, the Tito Santanas, the Iron Sheiks, the Ricky Steamboats, the Roddy Pipers, and the Dusty Rhodes who paved the way for Alberto and his big mouth. Since Alberto is so busy popping off about what he has, it isn’t even a drop in the bucket for all of the things that the legends did.</p>
<p>Alberto says that the only reason why Porter has those legends in the highest regard is because he will never be one of them. Alberto says that he is already a legend. Porter says that since Del Rio is a legend, he won’t mind getting Survivor Series started with a legendary beat down.</p>
<p>Alberto tells MVP that maybe it sounds like a great idea to him and to the WWE Universe. Tonight, there is going to be a fight, but it won’t be between each other because Alberto will be facing the little Chihuahua Rey Mysterio. Alberto says that even if he wasn’t in a match, Porter couldn’t handle him. Alberto says that if Porter wants a fight, he will bring out someone from Team Del Rio. He is going to bring the Chosen One, Drew McIntyre.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Seven: Alberto Del Rio versus Rey Mysterio in a Team Del Rio/Team Mysterio Survivor Series Preview Match V: The Mysterio Strikes Back</strong></p>
<p>They lock up and Alberto is forced to break the hold and he kicks Rey and then the referee pulls him off. Alberto sends Rey into the turnbuckles and punches him. Del Rio is warned by the referee again. Rey with forearms to Del Rio but Del Rio with an Irish whip. Rey with a float over and Rey kicks Del Rio in the leg. Del Rio with a knee to the midsection. Del Rio with a sunset flip but Rey with a round kick and he gets a near fall. Rey with a drop toe hold and Rey sets for the 619 but Alberto goes to the floor.</p>
<p>The other four members of Team Del Rio come to the ring and they go after Rey and the referee calls for the bell.</p>
<p>Winner: Rey Mysterio by disqualification</p>
<p>After the match, the members of Team Mysterio come out and we have pandemonium. Out to save the day is Smackdown’s human General Manager Teddy Long. Teddy says that since everyone from both teams are out in the ring and want to mix it up, they are going to do it right. It will be in a ten man Showdown Battle Royal and it will happen next. We go to commercial.</p>
<p>Match Number Eight: Ten Man Battle Royal featuring members of Team Del Rio and Team Mysterio in a Team Del Rio/Team Mysterio Survivor Series Preview Match: The Final Build for Survivor Series</p>
<p>The bell rings and Del Rio goes after Rey while Porter and Masters work on Reks. Show goes after McIntyre while Swagger and Rhodes work on Kingston. Rhodes goes after Show and Show chops Rhodes. Show chops Del Rio to save Rey and bring him back into the match. Show with a shhh chop to Del Rio. Show with a chop to Reks while Rhodes deals with Masters.</p>
<p>Rey tries to eliminate Del Rio but Del Rio regains control. Cody with a forearm to Masters but Masters with a chop. Rey kicks Del Rio while Porter holds him. Cody is sent to the apron but he holds on to the ropes until Masters connects with a forearm to send Rhodes to the floor to eliminate him. Swagger hits Porter from behind. Masters and Kingston send Reks over the top rope but Reks rolls in under the bottom rope. Rey with a triangle choke on Del Rio while hanging over the apron. Porter with a double sledge to Del Rio but Del Rio stays in the match. Masters is the next man eliminated.</p>
<p>Kofi kicks Reks and connects with a forearm. Show chops Del Rio but Del Rio kicks back. Del Rio and McIntyre work on Show but Show with a double noggin knocker. Swagger has Porter down in the corner. Kofi eliminates Reks and Rey sends Drew to the apron but he hangs on. Show and Kofi go after Del Rio. Kofi with a kick to Swagger and Show with a head butt to Del Rio. Porter with a knee drop to Del Rio. Kofi with forearms and kicks to McIntyre. Drew sends Kofi over the top rope to the apron and then he kicks Kofi off the apron to eliminate him.</p>
<p>Del Rio with a knee to Show followed by a punch. Porter with a running boot to the head of Swagger in the corner, but Del Rio takes advantage of Porter’s position to eliminate him. Drew gets Rey up but Show with a chop and Show eliminates Drew as we get down to four men, with two on each team left.</p>
<p>Swagger goes after Show while Rey and Alberto fight. Alberto has Rey on his shoulders but Rey goes forward and grabs the ropes to eliminate Del Rio. Swagger with a boot to Show’s knee. Rey with a seated senton splash off the turnbuckles. Swagger puts Rey in the ankle lock when he counters a wheelbarrow move. Rey rolls through staggers Swagger. Show with a savate kick that sends Swagger into the ropes. Rey hits the 619 and then Show grabs Swagger by the throat and sends him over the top rope to the floor to win the match.</p>
<p>Winners: Team Mysterio</p>

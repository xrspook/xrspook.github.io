<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: THE GM&rsquo;S RULING IS NON-MODIFIABLE . . . UNLESS YOU SAY PRETTY PLEASE; REKS AND HAWKINS SHOW A DIFFERENT SIDE OF THEIR CHARACTER; MEXICAN MASKED LEGENDS TEAM UP; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-08-17 22:01:52</p>
<p>We begin this week’s show with a look back at comments from Alberto Del Rio when he said that he was superior to Sheamus. Then we see how Sheamus got revenge by damaging Alberto Del Rio’s car. Then we see Booker T’s announcement last week that Alberto Del Rio was removed from the World Title Match at SummerSlam.</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Austin, Texas and your announcers are Michael ‘I asked Jim Ross to attend tonight, but he said no’ Cole and Josh ‘Chris Simms’ Mathews.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio comes to the ring with Ricardo Rodriguez and this time he is walking to the ring instead of worrying about Sheamus stealing another car.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he wants his World Title match back right now. He says that peasant Sheamus stole his car and it cannot be fixed. Somehow Sheamus gets rewarded. What kind of champion is Sheamus if he cries to the General Manager to get their match at SummerSlam cancelled.</p>
<p>What kind of General Manager is Booker T to agree to Sheamus’ demands. He says that he is the number one contender and he is not going to leave the ring until his title match is reinstated.</p>
<p>Booker T makes his way into the arena and he makes his way to the ring. Booker says that of all people he did not expect this from Alberto. He says that Alberto has been a pain in his side.</p>
<p>Alberto says that Sheamus messed with his property and he took care of Sheamus. That is what a real man does.</p>
<p>Booker says that a real man does not hire five goons to beat up one man. Alberto went past the boundaries and he will not allow that on Smackdown.</p>
<p>Alberto wants to know who Booker thinks he is to take away what is his. Alberto says that he earned the right to be the number one contender a long time ago. Alberto says that he talked to his lawyers . . .</p>
<p>Chris Jericho’s music plays and he makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Chris wants Alberto to shut the hell up. He says that nobody cares about his lawyers, his money, his fancy cars, his goofy scarves, his ring announcer, his big ears, his tiny nose, his greasy hair, or his incessant whining. He says that Alberto sounds like a Chihuahua.</p>
<p>Alberto calls Jericho a dog and then Jericho responds in Spanish.</p>
<p>Chris asks everyone if he should give Alberto a Spanish lesson. He tells Alberto that his breath smells like dog poop.</p>
<p>Alberto asks Jericho what he wants.</p>
<p>Chris says that since Alberto is not getting a title match at SummerSlam, after he beats Dolph Ziggler at SummerSlam, he can take Alberto’s spot in the match against Sheamus and become the new World Champion.</p>
<p>Alberto wants to know if Jericho is crazy. He saw a peasant steal his car. He is not going to let another steal his title match.</p>
<p>Chris and Alberto argue and Booker decides to jump in. Booker says that everyone knows that his word was laid down. Sheamus is not competing at SummerSlam so we can have a main event tonight. For the first time on Smackdown, Chris Jericho faces Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>With Alberto Del Rio already in the ring, we Chris Jericho walking in the back for his match. Dolph Ziggler attacks Chris Jericho in the back with the briefcase. While Vickie laughs maniacally, he runs a piece of equipment into Jericho. Ziggler tells Jericho that he cannot win the big one. Booker tells Ziggler to get out of there as he checks on Jericho. We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Alberto asks Jericho about those Spanish lessons now. Alberto says that he is the winner by forfeit and Ricardo makes the announcement. Alberto tells Booker that wants him to be granted his match for SummerSlam.</p>
<p>Instead of Booker, it is the man Alberto is scheduled to face and he is holding his midsection.</p>
<p>Match Number Six: Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) versus Chris Jericho</p>
<p>Del Rio tells Jericho that he cannot compete but Jericho with punches. Del Rio with a kick to the midsection followed by a boot to the midsection for a near fall. Del Rio with an Irish whip that sends Jericho sternum first into the turnbuckles. Del Rio leaps onto the chest and he gets a near fall. Del Rio slaps Jericho in the head and then he chokes Jericho while mocking him.</p>
<p>Jericho with punches to Del Rio followed by chops. Del Rio with a knee to the midsection and then he hits a drop kick to the head. Del Rio sets for the float over into the cross arm breaker but Jericho escapes and hits an enzuigiri. Jericho with a kick and knee to the midsection. Jericho punches Del Rio but Del Rio sends Jericho to the apron. Del Rio with a kick to the midsection and then he knocks Jericho off the apron and Jericho hits the announce table.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Del Rio with a rear chin lock and body scissors. Jericho with elbows to get out of the body scissors. Jericho with punches to Del Rio followed by a forearm. Jericho with a chop but Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker for a near fall. Del Rio kicks Jericho in the head. Del Rio with an Irish whip and enzuigiri into the corner. Del Rio gets another near fall.</p>
<p>Del Rio goes to the turnbuckles and he tries for a double stomp but Jericho moves and Del Rio falls to the mat. Jericho with kicks to the leg followed by a shoulder tackle. Del Rio with a back heel kick and slap to the head. Jericho with a forearm of his own and then Jericho with a Lionsault but Jericho is in too much pain to make the cover.</p>
<p>Jericho is able to crawl over and he gets a near fall. Del Rio with head butts and then he sends Jericho into the turnbuckles again. Jericho blocks an arm breaker and turns it into the Walls of Jericho. Del Rio is able to fight his way out of the hold and he kicks Jericho to the ropes but Ziggler has come out and he pulls down the ropes and Jericho goes to the floor.</p>
<p>Ziggler rolls Jericho back into the ring and Del Rio with a round kick for the three count.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>After the match, Alberto applies the cross arm breaker on Jericho and Chris taps out while Ziggler tells Jericho he can’t beat him or win the big one.</p>
<p>Sheamus’ music plays and he comes to the ring and he takes Del Rio to the mat and he punches Del Rio. Sheamus with more punches. Del Rio rakes the eyes but Sheamus with more punches. Del Rio with a kick to the injured arm. Del Rio sets for the cross arm breaker but they go to the floor. Sheamus chases after Del Rio and Alberto goes into the crowd with Ricardo.</p>
<p>Sheamus thinks about going after Alberto but Sheamus checks on Jericho instead.</p>
<p>Booker T comes out and he wants to know what Sheamus is doing here.</p>
<p>Sheamus tells Booker that he wants him to reinstate his match with Del Rio for SummerSlam.</p>
<p>Booker tells Sheamus that he is talking with his heart. He reminds Sheamus that he is injured.</p>
<p>Sheamus says that they will have to rip his arm off his body and that won’t even stop him from competing in the match. He asks Booker to reinstate the match.</p>
<p>Booker says that if he does that it will be for the World Championship.</p>
<p>Sheamus says that the only person who wants this match more than Del Rio is him. He asks Booker one more time to please reinstate the match.</p>
<p>Booker agrees to do it because that is what Sheamus wants. The match is back on for SummerSlam and it will be for the World Title.</p>

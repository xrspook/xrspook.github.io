<p><strong>411&rsquo;s WWE SmackDown Report 06.22.12</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Steve Cook on 06.22.2012</p>
<p>Match 2: Alberto Del Rio vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Christian</p>
<p>Tieup into the corner, ADR with a headlock, Christian sends him down with a shoulderblock &amp; tries a sunset flip for an early two count. ADR gains the advantage with a kick to the left elbow and sends him into the corner, weakening Christian for his cross arm-breaker finisher. He works him over in the corner, but Christian backdrops ADR all the way to the floor! Christian climbs up top and delivers a cross-body block to the floor just before we go to commercial!</p>
<p>ADR gained the advantage during commercial and has Christian in a variation of the Crossface before settling on an armbar. Christian fights out and tries a sunset flip, but ADR sees it coming and drops his elbow on Christian&rsquo;s arm. Did Arn Anderson book this match? Another elbow drop on Christian&rsquo;s arm gets two. ADR just putting on a clinic on working the arm right now with repeated strikes to it, it&rsquo;s really something to watch. He heads up to the middle turnbuckle though, and gives Christian the chance to rise up and hurricanrana him off! Christian rallies the crowd behind him and hits a few of his traditional offensive moves, but an attempted cross-body block off the top hits nothing but canvas! ADR misses his running enziguri in the corner! Christian hits the tornado DDT (using his injured arm) and gets a two count. ADR gets an advantage for a split second, but runs into Christian&rsquo;s boots in the corner, a middle rope dropkick by Christian gets two! Christian goes for the Killswitch, ADR reverses into a back suplex position but Christian slips out only to get an arm Stunner from ADR! (Sure, I&rsquo;ll call it that) Gets a two count. ADR misses a back senton off the middle rope, Christian motions for the spear…but runs into a crescent kick by ADR! ADR tries the cross arm breaker, reversed into a Killswitch attempt, Christian pushed into the corner, lands a couple of kicks on ADR before momentarily getting distracted by Ricardo Rodriguez…which kills enough time for ADR to deliver his flying enziguri to Christian while he&rsquo;s on the top rope! ADR applies the cross arm-breaker on Christian&rsquo;s good arm and it&rsquo;s good enough to get the victory!</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio (about 8 minutes) **1/2 I have to downgrade it a little bit because of the finish, which ignored all of the work on Christian&rsquo;s left arm by having ADR apply the cross arm-breaker to the right arm. Did he forget which arm he was working the whole match? I&rsquo;m also not a fan of the Intercontinental Champion losing a match to a non-champion when the title isn&rsquo;t on the line &amp; isn&rsquo;t a factor. Yes, we know the belt is meaningless, but you don&rsquo;t need to beat us over the head with it. There was some good action here and both of these guys are darn good wrestlers, but the booking &amp; the finish drag it down for me.</p>
<p>Cody Rhodes runs down and attacks Christian from behind! He applies the Fujiwara armbar to Christian&rsquo;s left arm and continues to work it over. At least he remembered which arm ADR targeted. He tells Christian he&rsquo;s stealing his time, and he is SmackDown. He&rsquo;ll get no argument from me.</p>

<p><strong>WWE SmackDown Recap: Sheamus vs. Ziggler, Kane vs. Daniel Bryan and More</strong></p>
<p>By Kyle Schadler (Senior Writer) on June 23, 2012</p>
<p>Christian vs. Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>Del Rio picked up the victory with the cross armbreaker. This was a really good match, as both Christian and Del Rio delivered some nice back-and-forth action. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting them to work this well together and I was quite glad to be wrong.</p>
<p>Christian is at the top of his game right now. The break he had to take due to his injury was a good thing. He came back rested and ready to go.</p>
<p>Del Rio sometimes doesn&rsquo;t get the credit he deserves, from myself included. He may put me to sleep on the mic, but the superstar from Mexico can wrestle a good match when given the chance.</p>
<p>Putting him in the ring with someone who can wrestle certainly creates an enjoyable match to watch.</p>
<p>Del Rio&rsquo;s skill in the ring is making me a fan of his, but his mic work still puts me to sleep. As soon as I&rsquo;m able to stay awake during one of his promos, I&rsquo;ll be completely on board with Alberto Del Rio.</p>

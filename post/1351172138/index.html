<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: EDGE&rsquo;S NEXT PAY PER VIEW OPPONENT DETERMINED; LAYLA AND MICHELLE HAVE ISSUES; SIN CARA MAKES HIS SMACKDOWN DEBUT; WRESTLEMANIA REMATCH WITH A DIFFERENT WRINKLE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-04-08 22:01:54</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Charlotte, North Carolina and your announcers are Josh ‘Why did I get Stunnered at Wrestlemania, I didn’t say Melina versus Alicia Fox’ Mathews, Michael ‘In addition to being Mr. Wrestlemania, I am Mr. Squirting BBQ Sauce on a Shirt’ Cole and Booker ‘Tell Me You Didn’t Stun Me on Sunday’ T.</p>
<p>Things start off with Alberto Del Rio, the man who could not reach his destiny on Sunday night and he is accompanied on foot by his official ring announcer Ricardo Rodriguez and Brodus Clay.</p>
<p>While Josh and Booker talk about the value of the car that Edge and Christian destroyed at Wrestlemania, Michael Cole chimes in with the sob story about the destruction of his habitrail. Cole vows that his home away from humanity will be better than ever.</p>
<p>Alberto is not as gregarious as he usually is but he reminds us who he is, but we already knew that. Alberto says that we may not know that destiny can be delayed. He says that destiny can be stopped. Last Sunday at Wrestlemania, his destiny was delayed by that opportunist Edge and the coward Christian. Together they destroyed his Wrestlemania moment and together they destroyed his car. Alberto talks about his beautiful Rolls Royce and he says that he spent $120,000 on that car. Alberto says that it is not about the money. Those cars are like his children. They think they may have broken him, but Alberto will make them pay.</p>
<p>When he fulfills his destiny and becomes the World Champion, everything that Edge did to his car . . .</p>
<p>is interrupted by Edge’s music and he comes into the building on a Brisco’s Brothers tow truck with Alberto’s destroyed Rolls Royce.</p>
<p>Edge tells Alberto that when he saw him crying and hugging his car on Sunday, he thought that Alberto was a greedy, arrogant, narcissistic moron who puts materialistic things over everything else in his life. Then when he heard Alberto say that his cars are like his children, then it got him thinking. He almost reassessed things and he figures that if he is like a child, he needs to love it unconditionally. It might be a little damaged but nothing a little tender loving care can’t fix.</p>
<p>Edge gets some spray paint and he decides to do a little touch up on the hood.</p>
<p>Alberto asks Edge if everything is a joke to him and then he reminds Edge that he had him close to tapping out on Sunday. Edge tells Alberto that he didn’t get the job done and that is why Alberto is in the ring whining and crying. That is also why he is the World Champion.</p>
<p>Alberto demands a rematch so Edge can redeem himself for his behavior at Wrestlemania.</p>
<p>Edge thinks about the rematch and he tells Alberto as much as he would love to give it to him, but Alberto lost. Edge tells him to buy a new car and drive to the back of the line. Edge says that there are so many worthy contenders who deserve a title match.</p>
<p>Edge thinks about some contenders and there is some honking from the truck and we see that Christian is driving the truck.</p>
<p>Edge says that Christian deserves a title match. Edge points out that Christian has beaten Del Rio twice. Edge tells Del Rio if he wants a fight, Edge has his destiny.</p>
<p>Edge walks to the ring but he is stopped by the sound of Teddy Long’s music.</p>
<p>Teddy tells them to wait a minute. They can talk about their destiny all they want, but it is still his show. Teddy says that if things are going to be settled, it will take place in a match. Alberto Del Rio will face Christian tonight to determine who faces Edge at Extreme Rules.</p>
<p>Teddy reminds us that Extreme Rules is the night that WWE gets extreme. That is why Edge will be defending the title in his specialty match, a ladder match.</p>
<p>It is time for the main event and we get Ricardo Rodriguez to introduce Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>Before the match starts, Edge makes his way to ringside to watch the match.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Four: Alberto Del Rio with Ricardo Rodriguez and Brodus Clay versus Christian in a Number One Contender’s Match</strong></p>
<p>They lock up and Del Rio with a waist lock. Del Rio with a forearm to the back followed by kicks. Del Rio with a side head lock and he holds on to the side head lock when Christian tries for an Irish whip. Del Rio with a shoulder tackle and a near fall.</p>
<p>They have a Greco Roman Knuckle Lock but Del Rio with kicks to Christian. Del Rio with a front face lock and Christian with a shoulder tackle and a near fall. Christian with a side head lock take down. Del Rio gets back to his feet and Del Rio punches Christian. Christian with punches to Del Rio and then he puts Del Rio in the ropes and he slingshots over the ropes for the uppercut but Del Rio knows it is coming and he gets out of the way. Christian returns to the ring and he throws Del Rio over the top rope on the other side of the ring and Del Rio lands in front of the announce table, where Edge is sitting with Booker and Josh.</p>
<p>Christian with a baseball slide that sends Del Rio off the apron. Del Rio looks at Edge and Edge tells Del Rio it isn’t about this as he holds up the hood ornament from Del Rio’s Rolls Royce and says that it is about this as he holds up the title belt.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Del Rio pulls Christian out of the ring and Del Rio sends Christian shoulder first into the ring steps. Del Rio sends Christian into the ringside barrier and then he chokes Christian with his boot. They return to the ring and Del Rio gets a near fall. Del Rio with a chin lock on Christian and he gets to his feet. Del Rio with a head butt followed by a back breaker and he gets a near fall. Christian struggles to get back to his feet and Del Rio kicks Christian. Del Rio with a kick to the back and he gets a near fall. Christian retreats to the corner and he connects with a kick in the corner.</p>
<p>Del Rio slaps Christian in the corner but when he goes back for more, Christian punches him. Christian goes up top but Del Rio stops him and Del Rio tries for a superplex and he hits it but Del Rio appears to have landed on his shoulder. Both men are down and the referee starts his count. Del Rio gets to his feet first but Christian gets a near fall with an inside cradle.</p>
<p>Del Rio punches Christian and then he tries for a clothesline but Christian moves. Christian with a punch followed by a clothesline that sends both men over the top rope to the floor. The referee starts his count and Del Rio sends Christian into the ring post and they return to the ring.</p>
<p>Del Rio goes to the turnbuckles but he misses a back senton when Christian moves out of the way. Christian gets his second wind and he punches Del Rio. Christian with a running forearm and then he goes to the second turnbuckle for a missile drop kick and he gets a near fall. Christian with a slingshot to the floor followed by the uppercut. Christian goes up top for a cross body and he gets a near fall.</p>
<p>Christian gets ready for the Killswitch but Del Rio with a kick and he tries for the float over into the cross arm breaker. Christian avoids the move and he pushes Del Rio into the turnbuckles. Christian misses a charge into the corner. Christian with a kick followed by an attempt for a sunset flip from the turnbuckles but Del Rio rolls through. Del Rio slingshots Christian into the turnbuckles and Del Rio floats over into the cross arm breaker, but Christian gets to the ropes.</p>
<p>Del Rio eventually releases the hold and Christian goes to the apron. Christian drops Del Rio across the top rope as he goes to the floor. Clay gets close to Christian so Edge gets up from the announce table and he spears Clay. Christian goes up top and Del Rio hits the step up enzuigiri and then Del Rio gets the three count.</p>
<p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p>
<p>After the match, Alberto celebrates his victory from the ramp while Edge stares at him with Christian next to him.</p>

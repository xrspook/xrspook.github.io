<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: SIX MEN IN THE RING MEANS TEDDY GIVES US A SIX MAN TAG MATCH; JOSH HAS A THEORY ON KAITLYN&rsquo;S SECRET ADMIRER; DID YOU KNOW THAT WWE HAS AN APP?; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-05-17 21:59:27</p>
<p>Extreme Rules is on Sunday and we have one show with a man who likes to make multi man matches out of nowhere. Who will Teddy put in a multi man tag match this week? What will the Shield do as they prepare to get their first shot at gold in WWE? What will Mark Henry do because that is what he do?</p>
<p>We are in Wichita, Kansas and your announcers are John ‘Wichita Lineman’ Layfield, Michael ‘The Manhattan skyline is not the same’ Cole, and Josh ‘Do I get a drinking game’ Mathews.</p>
<p>We begin with MizTV even though it was supposed to be the Highlight Reel. Miz is in the ring and he is dressed to talk. He says that his guests are bitter rivals and they will meet at Extreme Rules. Miz says that he wants to make tonight memorable.</p>
<p>Miz brings out Randy Orton and then he brings out Big Show.</p>
<p>Miz reminds them that in their match, anything goes. Miz brings up the issues that they have had since Wrestlemania so this match is one that people are anticipating.</p>
<p>We see footage from last week when Big Show knocked out Tensai in their match and then he was going to take care of Brodus Clay but Orton hits an RKO on Show.</p>
<p>Miz asks Big Show about the RKO and he asks if this is a preview of what is going to happen at Extreme Rules. Show says that he would expect a weasel like Miz to ask him a question like that. Orton hit that move because he came at him from behind. Orton attacked him at Mania and last week against Tensai.</p>
<p>There are no rules on Sunday so he can use whatever he wants to rip Orton apart. Show says that he does not need a weapon because he has one at the end of his hand. The last thing that the people will remember in St. Louis is a TKO, not an RKO.</p>
<p>Orton says that is a very interesting and entertaining story. There is one thing because the ending is inaccurate. Extreme Rules takes place in his home town and he is not going to let Show beat him in his home town. He won’t let Show knock him out in front of his friends and family.</p>
<p>Orton says that he made the mistake of trusting Show at Wrestlemania. The only thing that people will remember on Sunday is how the Viper struck down the Giant. Orton tells Show that he may not get back up.</p>
<p>Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter interrupt and Zeb says that everyone got it wrong. Sunday will be memorable but not because of Orton or Show. It is because Jack Swagger will make Alberto say I Quit, and he can say it in his native tongue. People will remember that Jack Swagger’s America becomes a reality on Sunday and he will emerge as the number one contender on Sunday. There will be thousands of Real Americans rising to their feet to say ‘We the People’.</p>
<p>Jack’s opponent will not be prevented from speaking and he makes his way to the ring with Ricardo Rodriguez. He tells Colter to shut up. He says that they are sick and tired of hearing Colter talk. The only thing that people will remember on Sunday is . . . Alberto Del Rio becoming the number one contender because he will make Jack say I Quit. He tells Jumanji man that he will make sure that Colter goes back to where he came from so he can never sneak into his business again.</p>
<p>It is time for the Curator of the Hall of Pain to make his way onto the stage because that is what he do. Mark says that people will remember Mark Henry setting world records pulling semis. People will remember him throwing, dragging, and beating Sheamus like no one has ever beaten him in his life. People will remember that he is the strongest man in the world because that is what he do.</p>
<p>Sheamus interjects himself into the conversation because that is what he do. Sheamus tells Lumpy that their strap match will be the most memorable especially when he leaves Mark’s carcass battered and bruised with welts and marks in the middle of the ring. Why wait until Sunday to leave a memory because we can do a preview now.</p>
<p>Sheamus hits the ring and he goes after Mark Henry while Del Rio and Orton take care of their opponents on Sunday night.</p>
<p>We go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and it is time for Teddy Long to do what he do. He makes his way to the stage and he comments on what we just saw. Teddy says that he is ready for Extreme Rules. Tonight’s main event will see the six men we just saw in the ring. Randy Orton, Sheamus, and Alberto Del Rio will face Big Show, Mark Henry, and Jack Swagger.</p>
<p><strong>Match Number Six: Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez), Randy Orton, and Sheamus versus Jack Swagger (with Zeb Colter), Mark Henry, and Big Show</strong></p>
<p>Swagger and Del Rio start things off and they lock up. Swagger with a side head lock and shoulder tackle. Del Rio with a hip toss and a kick to the back. Del Rio with a near fall. Del Rio with kicks and punches in the corner followed by a running step up enzuigiri and Orton tags in. Orton stomps on the hand and runs his boot laces across the face followed by a European uppercut and punches in the corner.</p>
<p>Swagger goes for the knee and he starts to work on the knee and he punches Orton in the head. Orton with a drop kick and then he tags in Del Rio who hits a super kick and gets a near fall. Del Rio puts Swagger in the ropes and he connects with forearms to the back and then he hits a lungblower.</p>
<p>Swagger goes to the floor and Del Rio with a suicide dive onto Swagger. Del Rio sends Swagger back into the ring and Del Rio goes up top but Swagger climbs the turnbuckles and hits a belly-to-belly throw. Show tags in and he punches Del Rio in the midsection and chokes him in the ropes.</p>
<p>Show stands on Del Rio’s back. Swagger with a kick to Del Rio when Show distracts the referee. Show with a chop to Del Rio’s chest. Del Rio with punches but Show sends Del Rio into the turnbuckles. Swagger tags back in and he connects with knees. Henry tags in and he connects with a series of head butts. Swagger tags back in and he runs into boots from Del Rio. Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker and both men are down. Show tags in and he hits an elbow drop to keep Del Rio from making the tag.</p>
<p>Show with a slam and we go to commercial.</p>
<p>We are back and Del Rio sends Swagger into the turnbuckles. Swagger misses a charge into the corner and his shoulder hits the ring post. Show tags in and he keeps Del Rio from making the tag. Show gets Del Rio up for a fallaway power bomb but Del Rio counters with a rana and both men are down. Del Rio crawls to his corner and he tags in Sheamus.</p>
<p>Sheamus with running double sledges and then he runs Show into the corner and hits a running knee lift. Sheamus goes up top but he flips over Show. Show grabs Sheamus by the throat but Sheamus escapes. Sheamus gets Show up for White Noise and he hits it. Sheamus pounds his chest for the Brogue Kick but Henry distracts Sheamus and Show blocks the Brogue Kick and Show hits a choke slam and Sheamus kicks out at two.</p>
<p>Swagger tags in and hits a series of elbow drops and then he slams Sheamus and hits a leg drop and gets a near fall. Swagger with a front face lock but Sheamus gets back to his feet. Swagger with a knee to the midsection but Sheamus catches Swagger and hits the fireman’s carry slam.</p>
<p>Henry tags in and he kicks Sheamus to keep him from making the tag. Henry punches Sheamus in the head and connects with forearms and punches because that is what he do. Show tags back in and Sheamus punches Show in the midsection and head. Show with a running shoulder tackle and he walks across Sheamus’ chest.</p>
<p>Show with chops across the chest followed by a punch to the midsection. Swagger tags back in and he connects with knees and follows with a short arm clothesline. Swagger with the double jump Swagger Bomb for a near fall. Swagger tries for another Swagger Bomb but Sheamus recovers and he hits Swagger in the back. Sheamus with an electric chair drop and both men are down.</p>
<p>Orton tags in and he hits a back breaker followed by two clotheslines and he avoids a clothesline from Swagger and then Orton with the power slam. Henry with a body block to Orton and Show sends Sheamus over the top rope to the floor. Del Rio with a step up enzuigiri to Henry that sends Mark to the floor. Sheamus with a Brogue Kick to Show on the floor.</p>
<p>Swagger ducks an enzuigiri and he applies the ankle lock but Orton with an RKO to Swagger for the three count.</p>
<p>Winners: Alberto Del Rio, Randy Orton, and Sheamus</p>

      <p>Episode 13</p>
<p>The episode began as it ended last week&hellip; Gutiérrez summons Natasha for an interview, Wilson finds the &ldquo;lost&rdquo; purse, and Don Hermes heads off to find Jenny in Hugo&rsquo;s workshop.</p>
<p>Jenny tries to smother Don Hermes in hugs while he asks that she calm herself. She tells him that she left Efraín because she was tired of his mistreatment and humiliations. He wanted <em>her</em> to support him! And what&rsquo;s more, he was going to take her to live in a single room when she was used to the apartment!! Don Hermes agrees that that is just too much, that when a real man takes charge of a woman he has to support her, take care of her [Merci: Ouch! Don Hermes has forgotten that we&rsquo;re in the 21st century now, and that his daughter is a complete professional who doesn&rsquo;t need any man to support her. Beth: &lt; <em>shudder</em> &gt; no to mention his conveniently forgetting that Betty was the &lsquo;breadwinner&rsquo; in that family for a while&hellip;]. You can tell Don Hermes is a bit nervous and things are going to get even more complicated because Jenny is on the attack with cannons and artillery. She wants his help so they will give her a raise as well as an advance on her next month&rsquo;s paycheck&hellip; [Merci &amp; Beth: She lives in the same &ldquo;real world&rdquo; Blondie-Barbie [Patricia] did!] Don Hermes replies that the advance may be tricky and the only thing he can to is speak with her bosses and suggest the pay raise. Jenny gets mad and says if he doesn&rsquo;t help her she&rsquo;ll be left out on the street. Don Hermes asks her why she doesn&rsquo;t spend the night at a [girl]friend&rsquo;s house, but Jenny explains that she doesn&rsquo;t have any [girl]friends - women hate her. Then she has the wonderful idea that Don Hermes should take her home to stay at <em>his</em> house! He tells her absolutely no way, don&rsquo;t even think about it. Jenny says of course, and that she doesn&rsquo;t want to make an enemy of Betty. She complains that she&rsquo;s all alone in life and that he [Hermes] has to help her find a solution to her problem [Beth: again, WHY??? i didn&rsquo;t like Jenny any more on BLF than i do here - they should&rsquo;ve just dropped her out a window then and put us all out of my misery. that or let Sofía deal with her. on the other hand, i&rsquo;ve never liked Hermes either, which makes this is a tough one - do i get outraged at Jenny for setting the women&rsquo;s movement back 5 million years, or at Hermes for what he&rsquo;s doing to Julia? because really, if it weren&rsquo;t for Julia i&rsquo;d say that Jenny can have Hermes and welcome to him, provided this is the last we see of either one!]. So, following the instruction manual of Blondie-Barbie, she asks him for a &ldquo;loan&rdquo; to pay for the taxi, check into a hotel, and get something to eat. Don Hermes says he&rsquo;s so sorry, but his money is already accounted for [Merci: old tightwad!], he&rsquo;s very strict with his budget. She tells him she left Efraín because of him [Hermes], because of following his advice, and now she&rsquo;s sorry she ever listened to him. She starts crying like an idiot and the old man takes pity on her [Merci: could it be so she&rsquo;d shut up?] and asks her how much she&rsquo;ll need. She tells him 100,000 pesos should do it. Don Hermes takes out a wad of bills that nearly makes Jenny&rsquo;s eyes pop out of her head. She hugs him and thanks him. Just then we hear Inesita calling Jenny; they separate and Don Hermes acts as if he was there looking for Hugo. Inesita thinks that&rsquo;s a bit strange and asks Jenny what Don Hermes wanted to talk to Hugo about. Jenny gives her some excuse to get out of it. Then she asks Inesita to give her advice so she&rsquo;ll stop suffering because of men. Inesita tells her she no longer remembers anything about that&hellip;</p>
<p>Sofía is on the phone with her son, who apparently wants her to let Efraín stay at their place that night because he doesn&rsquo;t have anywhere to go. Sofía refuses to let him stay at the house and obviously the son starts to cry - it all turns into a big drama. She begs him not to cry, says they&rsquo;ll talk later, she has a lot of work [Merci &amp; Beth: ha ha ha - &ldquo;work&rdquo;?!]. Sandra, Aura María and Bertha all tell her not to be like that, Efraín is the father of her children -a bad father, maybe, but still their father. Sofía tells them it&rsquo;s not fair, the guy doesn&rsquo;t have any money, he doesn&rsquo;t have any co-worker colleagues because he&rsquo;s unemployed, his family is far away. Her friends insist Sofía let him stay at the house; she says over her dead body. Sofía starts shouting no, no, no!! Gutiérrez opens his door and emerges with Natasha, who he has obviously hired to be the secretary to Fashion Group [Beth: what? without either Kenneth or Gabriela interviewing her first?!]. The Cartel cheers up and they congratulate her, giving high-fives. Natasha says that now they&rsquo;re all like sisters&hellip; Then she asks Sofía if she isn&rsquo;t happy for her and Sofía, who has her head down on her desk, tells her yes, she is. Natasha asks her what&rsquo;s wrong and acts as if she&rsquo;s very concerned. She asks, &ldquo;Sweetie, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; [Beth: note, here again she uses tú -the informal &ldquo;you&rdquo;- rather than &ldquo;Usted&rdquo;&hellip;]. She approaches Sofía and makes up a little story about how since her children are the most important things that Nature can give Sofía, Sofía has to help her ex-husband. Bertha tells Sofía that Efraín can sleep in the kids&rsquo; room or in &ldquo;the girl&rsquo;s&rdquo; room, to which Sofía replies that <em>she</em> was always &ldquo;the girl!&rdquo; At last they convince her and she calls her son to tell him that his father can stay with them. When she hangs up the phone she bangs her head on the desk&hellip;</p>
<p>Bertha notes that Freddy is leaving Hugo&rsquo;s workshop with Jenny, helping her carry her suitcases (&amp; the giant stuffed animal) toward the elevator. He asks her where she&rsquo;s going. They have to restrain Sofía from hitting Jenny, and Aura María gives Freddy a look that could kill. Freddy asks Jenny where she&rsquo;s going to stay and she tells him all alone at a hotel. Freddy tells her this worries him and offers to accompany her if she&rsquo;d like. She then replies that she&rsquo;ll call him to let him know where she&rsquo;ll be staying. Aura María says that apparently the Suitcase Woman found a husband. Bertha wishes them a good night, and Sandra adds if not, at least that they get some sleep. Freddy comments to Jenny that he senses people are jealous. Sandra states that Aura María shouldn&rsquo;t worry herself over this cur (Freddy) [Beth: the phrase used here is literally &ldquo;street dog&rdquo;]. Sofía&rsquo;s phone rings; it&rsquo;s her son calling to say that Efraín is going to stay with them indefinitely. Aura María tells Sofía they have to go to Inesita&rsquo;s to make sure she&rsquo;s looking her best for this first meeting with Efraín. Sofía both does and doesn&rsquo;t want to, and she lets herself be persuaded to go with them&hellip;</p>
<p>Nicolás comes out of the conference room and Bertha asks if the meeting is over already. He tells her it is for him. Then he asks Natasha how her interview went and she replies that they hired her. Nicolás comments that he has a lot of power at the company and reminds Natasha about going out to celebrate [with him]. Natasha makes a face like she doesn&rsquo;t want to go, but Nicolás won&rsquo;t take no for an answer. Finally she says that they can go as soon as she&rsquo;s spoken to the people from Fashion Group. Then Nicolás asks where the &ldquo;mini-girl&rdquo; (Sofía) is. When Bertha tells him she&rsquo;s with Inesita, Nicolás asks Bertha to order five empanadas and six blackberry juices for him.</p>
<p>Nicolás goes into his office and finds Don Hermes there counting money. He asks him &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up old man?&rdquo; Don Hermes replies that if he&rsquo;s going to call him &ldquo;old man&rdquo; it&rsquo;ll break his soul. Nicolás asks if he&rsquo;s going to take the &ldquo;germs&rdquo; out since he&rsquo;s going to the Pinzón aunts&rsquo; house [Beth: the word &ldquo;germs&rdquo; is another play on Hermes&rsquo; name similar to one Nicolás has used before&hellip; what he&rsquo;s doing here is teasing Hermes for never going out anywhere - as if Nico is really in any sort of a position to talk!].</p>
<p>Outside, Betty says good-bye to Gabriela and Kenneth, and asks Natasha if everything has been settled. Natasha says yes, and they all welcome her. Betty says good-bye to everyone and Natasha goes to talk with Kenneth and Gabriela.</p>
<p>Sandra asks Betty how the meeting went and if she&rsquo;d asked Armando about the database. Betty tells her no, she hasn&rsquo;t, but that Armando knows that she knows, and he&rsquo;ll soon see what&rsquo;s to be done.</p>
<p>In Armando&rsquo;s office, Mario asks how it could be that Betty knows the details of the &ldquo;Oracle of the Goddesses.&rdquo; Armando doesn&rsquo;t know, but he thinks maybe she overheard when he was talking to Mario, or perhaps she was on his computer and happened across it. What matters to Armando is that Betty knows about the Oracle and now he&rsquo;s in more trouble once again because of Mario. Mario tells him that <em>he</em> (Mario) is not to blame for Betty&rsquo;s having been snooping in Armando&rsquo;s private stuff in violation of Armando&rsquo;s right to privacy. Armando cannot believe that now Mario is playing the part of the great defender of the rights of the world. Mario tells him he doesn&rsquo;t want to meddle in Armando&rsquo;s life [Merci: ha, ha, ha&hellip;], that he understands [Merci: he coughs when he says this] that married people are married until death do them part, for better or for worse, etc, but that the man isn&rsquo;t the woman&rsquo;s private property when they marry [Beth: i <em>think</em> this is what is said&hellip; i believe a word or two may be missing from this part of the narrative and have extrapolated]. Armando asks Mario what he&rsquo;s trying to say. Is Mario implying that he (Armando) should get angry with Betty because she found out about the Oracle? Mario replies that Betty violated Armando&rsquo;s privacy, that he (Mario) didn&rsquo;t realize that being married meant you lose all your rights [Beth: Mario&rsquo;s in a fine position to talk about violating people&rsquo;s privacy&hellip;!]. <em>This</em> is why he&rsquo;s never married [Beth: except if he never realized it, how could it be the reason he&rsquo;s never mar- oh, never mind. i forgot the writers apparently only have half a brain between all of them]. Armando gives him a look as if to say, &ldquo;Thank God you never married!&rdquo; Mario tells Armando to go and abase himself before Betty so he&rsquo;ll feel better. Armando retorts that that&rsquo;s exactly what he&rsquo;s going to do [Merci: Armandito!! i don&rsquo;t believe it!]. And what&rsquo;s more, he tells Mario that it hurts him to be in Betty&rsquo;s bad graces because he LOVES HER!! [Merci: Yes, yes! they gave us back our Armando!] Armando heads towards Betty&rsquo;s office as Mario comments, outside Armando&rsquo;s hearing, because she is the boss [Beth: here we have yet another of Mario&rsquo;s wonderful plays on words - this time with the word &ldquo;amo,&rdquo; which is both a verb -the first person singular form of &lsquo;amar&rsquo; (to love) or &ldquo;i love,&rdquo; and a noun meaning &ldquo;owner&rdquo; or &ldquo;boss.&rdquo; thus we have Armando saying, referring to Betty, &ldquo;porque la amo!&rdquo; -because i love her!- while what Mario says -once Armando is out of earshot- is &ldquo;porque el amo es ella&rdquo; -because she is the boss. there used to be a lot of this in BLF -especially with Hugo- and it was one of the only reasons i missed Mario when he was finally, if deservedly, kicked out of Armando &amp; Betty&rsquo;s life on that show].</p>
<p>Outside we see the witch- excuse me, Natasha, speaking with Gabriela and Kenneth. They welcome her, show her her desk (Patricia&rsquo;s old desk), and explain that the phone lines are Fashion Group&rsquo;s. Natasha &lsquo;takes off the hooves&rsquo; [Beth: ?? this must be a Latin American saying with which i am not familiar -i&rsquo;m guessing it means something like &ldquo;goes for broke&rdquo;] and asks for a private office (!!) because she thinks she shouldn&rsquo;t be confused with the gang of secretaries from EcoModa who can&rsquo;t speak English. Kenneth says he&rsquo;s sorry, but this is the only desk there is. Natasha tells him that&rsquo;s ok, she doesn&rsquo;t have a problem with that, she doesn&rsquo;t discriminate [Beth: except, of course, when she does - like just now&hellip;].</p>
<p>Sofía emerges from Hugo&rsquo;s workshop looking very pretty. Everyone compliments her, even Natasha [Beth: the phrase used has a meaning similar to &ldquo;wolf whistles&rdquo; only using words, and less rude]. Mariana gets off the elevator and adds her compliments -wow, wow&hellip; She asks Natasha how her interview went and Natasha replies that she was hired. Mariana welcomes her and Natasha says she&rsquo;s happy to be working with all of them. Sofía and Inesita leave.Gabriela and Kenneth head toward the elevator as she tells him that she&rsquo;s dead tired and wants to leave. Kenneth says he still has a few things to wrap up. Gabriela tells him that those hips (referring to Aura María) are going to have him dancing to a rhythm he doesn&rsquo;t know, he should be careful&hellip;</p>
<p>Armando enters Betty&rsquo;s office and she hands him some papers for the deal with Fashion Group, asking him what he thinks. He says everything looks good. Then he comments on what she said about the database when she was speaking with Gutiérrez, and asks where she got that information. She is surprised he doesn&rsquo;t know, and tells him that he and his friend know perfectly well where she got it. She tells him she&rsquo;s sorry, but she couldn&rsquo;t help overhearing him when he was speaking with Mario and she feels very badly, but she guesses she&rsquo;s just going to have to get used to it. Armando tells her he doesn&rsquo;t like having &lsquo;mysteries&rsquo; between them and that this information is Mario&rsquo;s, not his. Then Betty asks if he didn&rsquo;t know about the information and the women on that list. He tells her no, he did know, but that he hasn&rsquo;t looked at it since he fell in love with her [Merci: So lovely!]. He explains that Calderón asked him to give him some numbers because he lost his Filofax, but that that&rsquo;s in his (Armando&rsquo;s) past. Betty tells him she understands how now he might want to relive his past, remember old times, go out with Mario, Gina Guzmán and her cousin&hellip; Armando tells her no, he is going to delete that file. And what&rsquo;s more [Merci: and once again the louse gets all cute and handsome], that he doesn&rsquo;t have any urge to go out with anyone other than Betty, what he most wants is to be with her&hellip; [Merci: And she didn&rsquo;t cover him with kisses! how did she stop herself?]. Then Betty tells him that it&rsquo;s good he wants to be with her, because that night is the dinner with the Pinzón aunts, but if he&rsquo;s got something else to do, it&rsquo;s not a problem. He says no, he&rsquo;d be happy to go to dinner with the aunts [Merci: Though his face has an expression like he&rsquo;d rather have a tooth extracted without anesthetic!].</p>
<p>Mariana, Sandra and Aura María are talking with Bertha - they&rsquo;re all ready to go. Bertha says that she&rsquo;s going to the ladies&rsquo; room and the rest reply, like always, she&rsquo;s going to eat. Bertha gets offended but you can see she has a little bag of potato chips&hellip; Sandra comments to her friends that she&rsquo;d like to go out and do something. Mariana tells Aura María to look in her address book and find them three hotties to go out with. Aura María replies that because of going out with Freddy she doesn&rsquo;t have any &lsquo;party&rsquo; contacts any more&hellip;</p>
<p>Freddy comes back from having taken Jenny to the hotel (apparently) and explains that he refused all Jenny&rsquo;s come-ons because he thought of going out with Aura María. She replies that, given the choice of going to a funeral and going out with him, she would prefer the funeral. Freddy goes to call someone from Sandra&rsquo;s desk while Aura María complains of the 3-peso dates with Freddy where they ended up playing dice&hellip; Freddy calls a &ldquo;Mirella&rdquo; on the phone and tells her that it&rsquo;s Freddy Estewart Contreras calling, and not to get so excited at hearing his name. He adds that he is freer than then wind and asks Mirella if she is as lovely as always. Kenneth appears and tells Aura María that he&rsquo;d like to speak with her and if she&rsquo;s headed for home, perhaps they could go out to eat. Freddy, hearing this, tells Mirella (as if in response to something she&rsquo;s said to him) that instead of going out to eat, they should go out to party, to dance. Aura María says the same to Kenneth. Kenneth is half-scared because he doesn&rsquo;t know how to dance. Aura María tells him not to worry, she is the best teacher he&rsquo;ll ever find. Behind the two, Freddy -still on the phone- is growing ever more enthusiastic about how well he knows how to dance, but without results: Aura María leaves with Kenneth who is now quite excited about the dancing and asks her if she is going to teach him the vallentano. Freddy, crestfallen, tells Mirella that he&rsquo;ll be by for her on his motorcycle and he understands that they will go to the boring cheap place that Aura María is always complaining about. Sandra and Mariana make fun of him and tell him that clearly a Gringo Executive beats a Messenger&hellip;</p>
<p>Don Hermes calls Julia to tell her he&rsquo;ll be leaving to get her in half an hour, to be ready because he doesn&rsquo;t want to arrive late at the Pinzón aunts&rsquo; house because they go to bed early. Nicolás is getting ready for his date with Natasha, putting on lotion, and tells Don Hermes that he&rsquo;s been made a doll [Beth: referring to Natasha&rsquo;s comments in the previous episode that Nicolás looks like a doll when he smiles]. Don Hermes replies yes, he looks like a ventriloquist&rsquo;s dummy. Nicolás points out that he (Nico) is going out with a woman 64 years younger than the ones Hermes is going to see that night, that his has curves and not arthritis. Natasha opens the door and says she&rsquo;s ready. Nicolás tells Don Hermes not to fall asleep.</p>
<p>The phone rings and Don Hermes answers. It&rsquo;s Jenny, who&rsquo;s at the hotel, but they don&rsquo;t want to let her register because she has to do so for a week and the money he gave her was only enough for one night [Beth: ok, i probably shouldn&rsquo;t bother to ask, but what sort of hotel won&rsquo;t let you check in for just one night??]. She also needs to guarantee her booking with a credit card, which she doesn&rsquo;t have. Don Hermes tells her his own card is just about maxed but she tells him not to worry - as soon as she gets her paycheck she&rsquo;ll pay it back [Merci: Truly, this chick learned her lessons well from Patricia Fernández]. Don Hermes doesn&rsquo;t want to do it, but he cannot resist. Jenny asks him to write down the address of the hotel where she is so he can come to help her. The cheeky guy, before leaving, grabs Nicolás&rsquo; aftershave and puts it on liberally. Betty opens the door and tells him she already spoke with Armando about the dinner with the aunts. Don Hermes tells her they have to be there early and Betty asks that he call her when he&rsquo;s heading out so they can all arrive together. She catches a whiff of Don Hermes and remarks that he&rsquo;s got aftershave on again&hellip;</p>
<p>Armando enters his office to find Mario using the computer - obviously checking the Oracle&rsquo;s database. Armando tells him he&rsquo;s going to delete the file and Mario is horrified - he cannot believe it! All those hours -nights!- that he put into designing the file! How can his life be erased just like that? [Beth: well, if Mario was the one who created it - why didn&rsquo;t he leave with a copy when he left the first time?] He tells Armando to think about it, that he could lose a friendship if he deletes it [Merci &amp; Beth: Oh, yes! do it!!], that he (Armando) should not let himself be manipulated like this by Betty&hellip; [Beth: but it&rsquo;s ok to be manipulated like this by Mario??] Armando replies that yes, note it is HIS wife, HIS office, HIS computer&hellip; Mario sees the battle is lost and starts to beg Armando to at least save the information on a diskette - out of masculine solidarity if for no other reason [He is pushing a diskette at Armando, who is not showing any signs of wanting to help Mario out even that much]. At this point Betty enters, startling the two. Betty remarks that she thought Armando was alone, and Mario says he was just leaving [As he leaves he is making frantic motions to Armando to save the file on the diskette]. Armando asks Betty if she&rsquo;s ready to leave for dinner with the aunts as he just wants to look over the papers from Fashion Group and delete the Oracle database. Betty seats herself on the sofa and tells him she doesn&rsquo;t want him to delete that file. Armando can&rsquo;t believe it and tells her that since he&rsquo;s explained what happened, he had thought to delete it so he could be more at peace, to avoid the temptation of looking at it and getting stupid thinking about things in his past. Betty replies that she wants to see the file [Merci: Now Armandito&rsquo;s really in trouble!]. He tells her she&rsquo;s crazy, this request is senseless, he wants this in his past, there are certain things a couple shouldn&rsquo;t discuss and this is one of those things. He doesn&rsquo;t want to open old wounds. Betty tells him that this seems very strange to her - it would be as if they still had dark corners in their relationship. Armando repeats that there are some subjects best left untouched. Betty tells him she bets looking at the file wouldn&rsquo;t upset her, and she asks Armando, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe me?&rdquo; Determined, she stands and goes over to the computer. Sitting in front of it, she starts to move the mouse around, asking him questions about the different categories. First she asks about the &ldquo;solteras agradecidas&rdquo; (grateful bachelorettes, or spinsters). Very gently [Merci: He&rsquo;s such a sweetie], Armando explains to her that these are part of the group of the most desperate women, women who know that the more time passes, the less likely it is they&rsquo;ll marry, so when they find a man they give their all&hellip; Betty asks about the &ldquo;urgents,&rdquo; the &ldquo;travelers&rdquo; category. These are always ready to go out to wherever with whomever. Then there&rsquo;s the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care-ists&rdquo; category. These, Armando explains, are women who don&rsquo;t care if the man is single, old, young, married, engaged, whatever&hellip;</p>
<p>As if to emphasize that last description, we cut to Jenny at the hotel, demanding a room with a queen-sized bed and a mini-bar. As she does so, Don Hermes arrives. Jenny is very happy to see Don Hermes hand his credit card over to the desk clerk, who also asks for his ID card. He doesn&rsquo;t want to give this to the clerk, but she tells him it&rsquo;s a house rule. Don Hermes wants to confirm they won&rsquo;t charge anything to his card and the clerk assures him that as long as the bill is paid [by the guest], there won&rsquo;t be any problem. Jenny thanks Don Hermes and asks him to come up to her room so he can see it and so she can thank him again for everything and he can have a drink. The old man reminds her he has a family dinner he has to go to but she convinces him it will only be for a moment. Don Hermes helps her with her bags. They arrive at the room, Jenny takes off her jacket and serves him a glass of brandy [Beth: from the mini-bar - i can hear the cash register on Don Hermes&rsquo; card going ka-ching! now&hellip;], telling him to have a seat on the bed. Don Hermes looks a bit uncomfortable, but not overly so. Jenny asks him to wait a moment as she heads for the bathroom&hellip; Don Hermes puts on his jacket as if to leave, but he doesn&rsquo;t. Instead he calls Doña Julia. She asks him where he is, and why he&rsquo;s keeping his voice down when he talks. He tells her he&rsquo;s at a funeral home. She asks him who died and he tells her an ex-colleague from work, Parrita. Julia is surprised because she just saw Parrita in the supermarket the day before. Hermes hurriedly amends his story to say that it was Parrita that called him because it was his <em>mother</em> who died. Doña Julia also exclaims at this since she&rsquo;d thought Parrita&rsquo;s mother died some two years ago. Don Hermes then tells her she&rsquo;s confusing him with all these interruptions [Beth: have i mentioned how very much i dislike Hermes&hellip;?], it&rsquo;s Parrita&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s mother who died. He doesn&rsquo;t give her a chance to say more but quickly tells Julia he&rsquo;ll see her in half an hour and hangs up. He serves himself another drink, hears the shower running, and cannot believe that Jenny is going to keep him there waiting while she bathes. So he knocks [tentatively] on the bathroom door, tells &ldquo;señorita Jenny&rdquo; through the door that he has to go, they&rsquo;ll speak tomorrow at Ecomoda. She emerges all wet with a towel around her and Don Hermes repeats that he has to leave. She tells him to wait, she&rsquo;ll be out in two minutes. Don Hermes falls back onto the bed with a face like he&rsquo;s asking himself, &ldquo;What have I gotten into&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advances for next week&hellip; It seems as if Jenny has a little surprise prepared for Don Hermes - a black &lsquo;baby-doll&rsquo; (negligée)&hellip; And Armandito will continue to explain the &ldquo;Oracle of the goddesses&rdquo; to Betty. Things get interesting and it goes on for quite a while, because the guy has to loosen his tie during the process&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>WWE MAIN EVENT REPORT: THE HIGHLIGHT REEL; A &lsquo;TITLE FREE MATCH&rsquo; BETWEEN DOLPH ZIGGLER AND ALBERTO DEL RIO; PAUL HEYMAN SPEAKS FOR CM PUNK; AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-02-13 23:31:17</p>
<p>After last week’s three match episode of Main Event, what will happen on this week’s show? We know that the Highlight Reel will make its return to WWE television on tonight’s show but what else will happen?</p>
<p>We are in Little Rock, Arkansas and your announcers are Michael ‘Paula Jones’ Cole and John ‘Linda Tripp’ Layfield.</p>
<p>Chris Jericho makes his way to the ring for the Highlight Reel and he has the Jeritron 6000.</p>
<p>He welcomes everyone to the Highlight Reel for the first time on Main Event. Unfortunately, the Miz was supposed to be his guest tonight, but he was injured on Raw. We get the monkeys to show us what Antonio did to Miz.</p>
<p>Chris calls it a vicious beat down. He has another guest who has equal or greater value.</p>
<p>Chris is about to introduce his guest but Ricardo Rodriguez comes into the ring to do the official introduction for Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>Alberto thanks Chris for having him on his show tonight. He does not want to talk about Big Show because the time for talking is over. He will beat the Big Show on Sunday to remain the World Champion.</p>
<p>Chris wishes Alberto luck because someone needs to take down the big and stinky Big Show. Chris says that he has a link to Alberto and his family. Alberto’s father took care of him when he was wrestling in Mexico.</p>
<p>Chris says that if and when he wins at the Elimination Chamber, he will face Alberto at Wrestlemania. Chris says that he will beat Alberto at Wrestlemania to become the new World Champion.</p>
<p>Alberto tells Chris that will not happen.</p>
<p>Chris says that he hablas Espanol tambien.</p>
<p>They go back and forth and then Ricardo makes it un Triple Threato. Ricardo takes over the conversation and he talks too fast.</p>
<p>Chris wants to know what Ricardo just said and that is a cue for Dolph Ziggler to make his way to the ring with AJ Lee and Big E Langston.</p>
<p>Dolph wants to know how many times he has to come out here to say that they are wasting their time talking about the World Title if they are not mentioned.</p>
<p>AJ tells Dolph he needs to tell them again.</p>
<p>Chris says that Dolph has told us 87 times, or the same number as the amount of mouths AJ has had her tongue down with WWE Superstars.</p>
<p>AJ and Big E do not appreciate Chris’ comments.</p>
<p>Chris wonders what the ‘Big E’ stands for. He suggests Big Easter Bunny? Big Elephant? Big Ears? Big Ego? Big Emu? Big Edward? Big Eggs? Big F Hutton? Big Excrement? Big Urkel?</p>
<p>Dolph tells Langston not to get upset whether it is someone who thinks they are going to win the Elimination Chamber or someone who thinks they will get past the Big Show at The Elimination Chamber. Dolph says that some time between now and Wrestlemania, he will cash in and become the World Champion.</p>
<p>Alberto tells Dolph that it is time for someone to teach him a lesson. That someone is him. He says that he will do it right now.</p>
<p>Chris has an idea. He asks the people of Little Rock if they want to see Dolph Ziggler versus Alberto Del Rio.</p>
<p>It looks like we have a match.</p>

<p><strong>2/13 Shore&rsquo;s WWE Main Event live coverage: Dolph Ziggler vs. Alberto Del Rio</strong></p>
<p>Feb 13, 2013 - 07:00 PM</p>
<p>By Chris Shore</p>
<p>WWE Main Event on ION</p>
<p>Taped on 2/12 in Little Rock, Arkansas.</p>
<p>A video hyped the Highlight Reel for the first time on Main Event and a recap of the Rock vs. CM Punk moments from Raw…The opening video aired, followed by the pyro, and Michael Cole and JBL welcomed us to Main Event. Chris Jericho&rsquo;s music hit and he came to the ring for the Highlight Reel. Jericho said Miz was supposed to be his guest, but he was injured on Raw. A video recapped the attack from Antonio Cesaro,</p>
<p>Jericho said he had a guest of greater value. He started to introduce him when Ricardo Rodriguez popped into the ring. Jericho stepped aside and let Ricardo introduce Alberto Del Rio as the guest. Del Rio got a good, but not great, reaction from the crowd. Del Rio thanked Jericho for having him, but said he didn&rsquo;t want to talk about Big Show because the time for talking was over. He said he would beat Show this Sunday, and that got a good pop.</p>
<p>Jericho wished Del Rio luck and said he had great respect for Del Rio&rsquo;s family, but he was going to win the Elimination Chamber and go on to beat Del Rio at Mania. Del Rio said it wasn&rsquo;t going to happen and added something in Spanish. Jericho said he spoke Spanish too and said something to Del Rio. Del Rio corrected his Spanish and they argued about it in Spanish. Ricardo jumped in and rambled faster and faster in Spanish until he collapsed into gibberish. Jericho asked him what the hell he said and Del Rio said, &ldquo;Yeah, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dolph Ziggler&rsquo;s music hit and he and his crew headed to the ring area. Ziggler said he guessed he needed to tell them again that you couldn&rsquo;t talk about the World Championship unless they were also talking about him. Jericho said he had told them about 83 times, the same number of times AJ had her tongue in someone&rsquo;s mouth. Langston got mad and Jericho cracked on him about what the &ldquo;E&rdquo; in his name meant. Ziggler calmed Langston down and said he was going to cash in his briefcase and win the title soon.</p>
<p>Del Rio said Ziggler needed to learn a lesson, and he was going to teach it to him tonight. Jericho said that was a great idea and asked the fans if they wanted to see the match. Ricardo lead the crowd in a &ldquo;Si! Si! Si!&rdquo; chant…[C]</p>
<p>Shore&rsquo;s Slant: Fun opening segment. I would have rather seen the match pre-announced and given the big build treatment, but this was still fun. Ricardo was hilarious with his gibberish, and Jericho and Del Rio cracked me up looking at him.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio (w/Ricardo Rodriguez) vs. Dolph Ziggler (w/AJ and Big E Langston). Del Rio took quick control and dumped Ziggler to the floor where he strategized with AJ and Langston. Back in the ring, Ziggler pulled an attacking Del Rio forward into the post and Del Rio fell to the floor…[C] Back from commercial, Ziggler worked a rest hold while a video showed him slamming Del Rio into the barricade during the break.</p>
<p>Ziggler hit two great drop kicks for near falls. He went for a third, but Del Rio caught his feet and hit a slingshot into the corner. Ziggler made his feet and went to the top, but Del Rio ran up the buckle and hit a sudden superplex that both men sold…[C]</p>
<p>Back from commercial, a brawl continued. Ziggler hit a big DDT I missed but it was for a great near fall. Del Rio came back and hit his strikes in the ropes followed by the back stabber. He covered, but AJ put Ziggler&rsquo;s foot on the ropes to break the count. Del Rio yelled at AJ and Ziggler hit a bulldog for two.</p>
<p>Del Rio hit a surprise armbreaker and setup for the enziguri. Ziggler ducked and hooked the sleeper. Del Rio sold it to one knee and then slung Ziggler off. He hit the enziguri and covered for a great near fall. AJ distracted the ref, and Langston punched Del Rio. Ricardo hit Langston with the bucket and ran when Langston no sold it. Del Rio hit a surprise kick and locked in the cross arm breaker for the win…</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio defeated Dolph Ziggler at 21:47.</p>
<p>Shore&rsquo;s Slant: What a great match. It was so good I forgot to track the quarter hour breaks. Oh well, we never get the quarter hour ratings anyway. I didn&rsquo;t like the very last part of the finishing sequence. It seemed too sudden. That&rsquo;s a minor complaint though. See this match folks. Awesome stuff.</p>

<p><strong>411&rsquo;s WWE Main Event Report 2.13.13</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Michael Benjamin on 02.13.2013</p>
<p>Jericho is on his way down to the ring as we kick off the show. Cole is pimping how many Elimination Chamber matches he&rsquo;s been in. Oh yeah, how many has he won? Jericho explains that Miz couldn&rsquo;t make it tonight because of the brutal attack from Antonio Cesaro on Monday. They replay it. I love it. Jericho&rsquo;s about to introduce Alberto Del Rio as the replacement guest but Ricardo insists that he makes the introduction. Here comes ADR to a real good pop. It&rsquo;s kind of weird seeing all three of these guys in the ring as babyfaces.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about Big Show anymore and then proceeds to talk about him. He says that he&rsquo;ll defeat Big Show at the Chamber. Jericho says that he has nothing but respect for Alberto and his family. Despite that respect, if Jericho wins at Elimination Chamber he&rsquo;s going to go on to beat ADR for the title at Mania. Alberto says that he doubts that will happen. Things break down quickly and all three men are going back and forth in Spanish. Ricardo was going on a hilariously long winded rant before&hellip;</p>
<p>Ziggler, accompanied by AJ and Langston, interrupt the argument. I could have gone for another 5 minutes of that. Jericho speculates as to what the E stands for in Big E Langston. Seems like the crowd liked &ldquo;Ear Wax&rdquo; the best. Big E is getting frustrated but Ziggler cuts him off. He calms Big E down and declares that he&rsquo;ll be cashing in his contract before Mania. Alberto says that he wants to shut Dolph Ziggler up tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Dolph Ziggler (w/ Big E and AJ) vs. Alberto Del Rio (w/ Ricardo)</strong></p>
<p>The match is official and here we go. Alberto locks in the side headlock. Dolph gets out of that and hits the ropes. Alberto hits a nice hip toss on Dolph. Big E pulls Ziggler out of the ring so that he can catch is breath. Aw. That was nice. Ziggler&rsquo;s back in and Alberto immediately corners him. Some kicks and a clothesline from Alberto. Alberto gets him in the middle of the ring and goes for a suplex. Ziggler reverses that and hits a snap suplex on ADR. It&rsquo;s time for DZ to mount some offense. He gets a two count off a neck breaker. Dolph locks in a side headlock and Alberto quickly makes it to his feet. He hits the ropes and Ziggler turns him inside out with a clothesline. Alberto eventually regains control and charges at Ziggy in the corner. DZ evades that situation and Alberto goes shoulder first into the ring post. Ricardo is checking on him outside of the ring as we head to&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back as Ziggler drops seven elbows on Alberto. He stops as soon as the crowd starts counting out loud. That&rsquo;s a nice little heel tactic. Alberto fights out of a sleeper and hits the ropes. He ends up getting dropkicked and Ziggler gets a 2.5 count! He gives ADR a strong whip into the corner. He waits for ADR to get to his feed and hits another dropkick. This time for 2.6! Why didn&rsquo;t he go for the Zig Zag though? ADR catapults Ziggler into the top turnbuckle and the tides have turned. Ziggler makes it to his feet in the corner and Alberto charges! Ziggler back body drops him over the ring post! He rolls him in and gets a 2.7! Ziggler goes to the top rope but ADR crotches him. Ziggler his sitting with his back to the ring. ADR hits a huge reverse suplex! These, guys are seriously putting it all on the line tonight. Both men are down and we head to another commersh break. We&rsquo;re getting more!? Awesome.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back and Ziggler and Del Rio are slugging it out! Boo! Yeah! Boo! Yeah! Dropkick by Ziggler! Ziggler misses a splash in the corner and here comes Alberto! Tilt-A-Whirl backbreaker on Ziggler! This crowd is rabid for Alberto! Kick to the fact! 2.89999! What&rsquo;s he gonna have to do!? He&rsquo;s calling for the cross arm breaker as the crowd chants Si! Ziggler counters with a HUGE DDT! 1&hellip; 2&hellip; NO~! Alberto makes it to his feet! Ziggler misses a clothesline and gets locked up in the ropes! Alberto delivers some punches to the ribs and a Back Breaker. AJ puts Zigglers foot on the ropes! ADR is like WTF at AJ and turns around only to get hit with a Fameasser! Alberto works the arm and calls for the arm breaker again! Alberto charges at Ziggler in the corner but Ziggler jumps up and catches a sleeper! Del Rio makes it to his feet and gets an enziguri for TWO! Del Rio sets him up! Ziggler pushes him off and he goes face first into a fist by Langston! AJ is distracting the ref! Ricardo attacks Langston and Langston chases him to the back. In the ring, Alberto locks it in finally! It&rsquo;s over! That was an awesome TV match. There was never a dull moment. And before anybody says anything - NO! Ziggler did not look weak at all.</p>
<p>OFFICIAL RESULT: Alberto Del Rio @ about 23:00 via submission.</p>
<p>RATING: ****</p>
<p>OVERALL: This was a great episode of Main Event. The Highlight Reel was short and entertaining. Everybody in there was great on the stick so that&rsquo;s no surprise. Alberto Del Rio vs Dolph Ziggler was definitely a PPV quality match like the early reports suggested. They did a great job hyping up the Elimination Chamber too. It was a little weird that we ended on a Raw Rebound but Del Rio vs Ziggler was so good that it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Go out of your way to find that match if you can.</p>

<p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: NEW GENERAL MANAGER; DOES ZIGGLER TRY TO CASH IN THIS WEEK?; SIX MAN TAG ACTION; TWO GOLDMAN BOXES THIS WEEK</strong></p>
<p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-08-03 22:01:54</p>
<p>We are live on tape from Indianapolis, Indiana and your announcers are Michael ‘Why are people complaining about my Peyton Manning jersey’ Cole and Josh ‘Jimmy Chitwood for Smackdown GM’ Mathews.</p>
<p>Vince McMahon is introduced by Lillian Garcia and he makes his way to the ring.</p>
<p>Michael Cole mentions the job that AJ Lee did on Monday night on her first night on the job.</p>
<p>Vince says that selecting a General Manager for Smackdown has been an arduous task. He wanted to find someone people would respect. He also wanted to find someone with integrity, character, and charisma as well as experience. He wanted someone who would use their authority and back it up. Vince introduces the new General Manager . . . Booker T.</p>
<p>Booker makes his way to the ring and he shakes Vince’s hand.</p>
<p>Michael Cole sucks up to Booker and says that Booker cannot do a worse job than Teddy Long.</p>
<p>Booker thanks everyone and then he says that he wants to thank Vince and the WWE Board of Directors for giving him this opportunity. Friday Night Smackdown is about to blow up. Booker says that we should get this started right now.</p>
<p>Alberto Del Rio’s music plays and he walks to the ring.</p>
<p>Alberto applauds Booker as he enters the ring and he has something to say. Alberto wants everyone to give it up for Booker T. He congratulates Booker on being the new General Manager of Smackdown. Booker must be happy because he is going to be working with Alberto because Alberto will be the new World Champion at SummerSlam.</p>
<p>Booker tells Alberto that if he is going to suck up, he has to be a lot smoother and not make it sound like a bunch of crap. Booker says that he heard what Alberto had to say about Sheamus.</p>
<p>Alberto tells Booker that Sheamus is beneath him and nothing but a peasant. He grew up as a fat red headed hooligan. Alberto says that he has the blood of champions in his DNA. He was bred for greatness. Alberto was going to say that he doesn’t have to kiss Booker’s butt but Sheamus interrupts Alberto.</p>
<p>Sheamus comes to the ring and he is dressed to fight. Sheamus congratulates Booker on becoming the new Smackdown General Manager. He says that unlike Bertie over there, he means it. Sheamus tells Booker that the first pint is on him. Sheamus tells Alberto that he can talk about where he grew up all he wants, but Sheamus says that he is proud of where he came from and who he is. He didn’t have someone brushing his teeth or wiping his arse when he was younger.</p>
<p>Sheamus says that he would also not ask for three weeks off so his manicured nails won’t get dirty. He asks Alberto if he is not going to wrestle before their match at SummerSlam.</p>
<p>Booker says nay nay and tells Alberto and Sheamus that they have matches.</p>
<p>Alberto says that he does not care who Booker is but he will not compete until SummerSlam.</p>
<p>Booker tells Alberto that he might have all the money in the world, but it does not mean that he can hear better. Booker says that he is the boss and Alberto will compete, sucka, in the center of the ring. Alberto will face none other than Randy Orton.</p>
<p>Booker tells Alberto to get his boots on and get those boots a-clickin’.</p>
<p>Booker tells Sheamus that he appreciates what he said earlier, but Sheamus is wrestling next and he will be in a knockdown, toe to toe fisticuffs with . . .</p>
<p>Tensai.</p>
<p>Matt Striker is in the locker room with Randy Orton and he mentions Randy’s two month layoff. Matt asks Randy about how the long layoff has affected him. Randy says that the WWE is his life and every moment away from Raw or Smackdown is like air taken from his lungs.</p>
<p>Orton says that Del Rio is the number one contender because Alberto never beat him. Orton says that he is going to give the fans what they want. He is going to hit a perfect RKO on Del Rio.</p>
<p>Match Number Six: Randy Orton versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez)</p>
<p>Del Rio with a kick and punch and then he backs Orton into the corner with kicks and then he tries to work on the arm using the ropes. Orton with a kick and he punches Del Rio. Del Rio with an Irish whip but you don’t Irish whip Orton into the corner without getting a clothesline for your troubles. Del Rio pushes Orton away but Orton with clotheslines into the corner. Orton punches Del Rio and then he goes to the ropes and punches him ten times.</p>
<p>Del Rio goes to the floor to discuss strategy with Ricardo. Alberto returns to the ring and is back body dropped by Orton. Orton with a kick to the chest and he sets for the IEDDT but Del Rio gets back into the ring. Del Rio sends Orton to the apron and he kicks Orton in the shoulder and then drops the back of Orton’s neck against the top rope.</p>
<p>Del Rio sends Orton into the ringside barrier and then he kicks him and sarcastically welcomes Randy back. Del Rio gets a near fall. Del Rio starts to work on the back with a boot and a knee in the back while he applies a rear chin lock. Orton with elbows and punches but Del Rio with a head butt.</p>
<p>Orton with a back breaker after avoiding a clothesline. Orton with a boot to the chest and abdomen. Orton tries for a leaping knee drop but Del Rio moves out of the way. Del Rio sends Orton into the corner and then he hits a step up enzuigiri to the back and gets a near fall. Del Rio mocks Orton’s push ups and he kicks Orton.</p>
<p>Orton kicks back but Del Rio with a punch. Del Rio with a hard Irish whip and kick to the head. Del Rio with another Irish whip but Orton moves when Del Rio charges into the corner and Del Rio hits the ring post with his shoulder. Orton with a rollup for a near fall.</p>
<p>Orton with two clotheslines and then he avoids a clothesline from Del Rio and that means it is power slam time. Orton sends Del Rio to the apron for the IEDDT and he hits it. Orton looks into the crowd and then he twists into the RKO push ups but Ricardo knows what is coming and he attacks Orton. The referee calls for the bell.</p>
<p>Winner: Randy Orton by disqualification</p>
<p>After the match, Del Rio with an arm breaker and then he tries to float over into the cross arm breaker but Orton escapes. Orton sends Del Rio into the turnbuckles and then Orton hits a drop kick.</p>

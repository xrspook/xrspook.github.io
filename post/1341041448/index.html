<p><strong>411&rsquo;s WWE Smackdown Report 6.29.12</strong></p>
<p>Posted by Tony Acero on 06.30.2012</p>
<p>Before Del Rio comes out, he berates the crowd and heads to the ring. He says at the end of the night, he&rsquo;ll be the champ. He is interrupted by Vickie, who has something to say, apparently. Vickie says that tonight, he is not going to win. The crowning jewel of her week is getting to introduce to him the next champion, Dolph Ziggler. And here he comes!!</p>
<p>Due to internet issues, the following is a summary of the match, rather than a play by play, and will thereby not have a star-rating.</p>
<p>Match 7: World Heavyweight Championship Match</p>
<p>Dolph Ziggler vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. Sheamus</p>
<p>Sheamus starts fighting both men, immediately, then sends Ziggler over the top rope. Del Rio tries to attack in the corner, but Sheamus is able to reverse a whip, sending Del Rio into the corner. The action spills to the outtside where Sheamus chases Ziggler around the ring only for Del Rio to attack Sheamus. Del Rio gets slammed into the steps by Ziggler before the action gets back into the ring and a pin onto Del Rio by Ziggler is had but only for a two. Sheamus is on the apron only to get knocked off and as he is doing so, Del Rio heads to the corner. Ziggler moves and Del Rio hits his shoulder hard. Ziggler with the strikes and he goes for a Superlex. Del Rio fought out of it, only to be sent to the outside just as Sheamus comes in to back suplex Ziggler. How convenient.</p>
<p>Del Rio comes in just as Sheamus is rising, and hits a dropkick before all three men head outside again. Del Rio and Ziggler attack Sheamus&rsquo;s head before Ziggler tosses him over the announce booth. Back in the ring, and Del Rio goes for a cover. Dolph breaks the pin, ending their short lived alliance. They begin choppin at each other till Sheamus hits a shoulder block to both from the top rope, then hits a knee to Del Rio and a body slam to Dolph. Sheamus sends Ziggler over the ropes to bang on his chest a bit, and when Del Rio goes for an arm breaker from behind, Sheamus turns it into the Irish Curse! Pin for 2 as Ziggler breaks it up. Ziggler attacks Sheamus, but Sheamus hits the White Noise. He&rsquo;s getting ready for the Brogue Kick, but here&rsquo;s Del Rio for the arm breaker. He doesn&rsquo;t get it, as Sheamus sends him into the corner. Sheamus gets dropkicked on the shoulder, and Del Rio tries for the armbreeaker agian, but Ziggler breaks it up. Sheamus rolls outside just as Ziggler hits a rocker dropper and a pin for 1&hellip;2&hellip;NO! Ricardo tries to distract, but Ziggler sends Del Rio flying into him and rolls him up for a 1&hellip;2&hellip;NO!!! Sheamus hits a Brogue Kick to Ziggler while he has Del Rio rolled up. Sheamus sends Del Rio to the outside and pins Ziggler for the 1&hellip;2&hellip;3!!</p>
<p>Winner: Sheamus</p>

<p><strong>WWE SmackDown: Sheamus Retains, Money in the Bank Qualifiers and More</strong></p>
<p>By Kyle Schadler (Senior Writer) on June 30, 2012</p>
<p>Sheamus vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. Dolph Ziggler: World Heavyweight Championship</p>
<p>Sheamus retained his title here after hitting the Brogue Kick on Ziggler. This was a good triple threat match. It featured constant action as all three wrestlers seemed at the top of their game.</p>
<p>Ziggler keeps proving that he is one of the best in the WWE right now. He is certainly the future of the WWE.</p>
<p>Del Rio has been less boring as of late. He had a very good match with Christian last week, was a bit entertaining on Raw and delivered here in this match.</p>
<p>Sheamus continues to deliver as world heavyweight champion as well. This match topped off this episode in a good way.</p>
